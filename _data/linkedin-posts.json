        "text": "Feb 11th 2001 - exactly 25 years ago - was the first day of a 3-day meeting at the Snowbird ski resort in Utah that gave birth to the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.\n\nLike all important documents, most folks who think they know what it says don't appear to have actually read it.\n\nThere's no mention of \"sprints\", or \"story points\", or \"user stories\", or \"build pipelines\" or \"Kanban boards\" or any of the other details of specific Agile methodologies. The Manifesto isn't a \"how-to\" guide. It's a \"why-to\" guide.\n\nIt lays out a set of values and principles for teams who wish to be more responsive to changing user and business needs, through continuous learning and adaptation in a highly people-centric - and especially customer-centric - process.\n\nOn the front page of the manifesto's website, it states:\n\n\"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.\n\nThrough this work we have come to value:\n\n- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n- Working software over comprehensive documentation\n- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n- Responding to change over following a plan\n\nThat is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.\"\n\nThe values and principles of Agile Software Development describe what it is like to *be* agile (with a small 'a'). We do not \"do\" agile. We do not \"adopt\" agile. We do not \"implement\" agile.\n\nWe *become* agile.\n\nThe manifesto itself is, of course, a laudable but compromised attempt to bring multiple iterative and \"lightweight\" development methodologies - different \"brands\" - under one banner.\n\nOne of those brands came to dominate in the minds of software developers. \n\nAnother came to dominate in the minds of managers and executives, and ultimately came to dominate economically. This was a mistake.\n\n\"Agile Software Development\" is doing software development in an agile way. It's not a management thing. \n\nAgile teams are self-organising, because putting decision-making power where (and more importantly, when) decisions need to be made - and therefore understood - is one of the keys to unlocking greater agility. A chain of command almost always becomes a serious bottleneck.\n\nThe other key message that got lost in translation is the need for strong technical chops. Teams who can't deliver rapidly, reliably and sustainably get micromanaged, and that ends their experiment in agility.\n\nWithout development teams with strong technical *discipline* who are empowered to make decisions, Agile Software Development becomes little more than Agility Theatre. And that's the reality for the majority of teams today - command-and-control waterfall development wearing an Agile Halloween costume.\n\nI recommend reading the manifesto again (or for the first time). Perhaps do it as a team. Maybe talk about how the values and principles could or are helping, and identify where your organisation might just be play-acting",

Martin, \"Clean Architecture\"\n\nIn today’s fast moving (technology) world, success is not only about speed, innovation or the right product-market fit, it is also about standing on the right foundation.\n\nA strong cloud foundation isn’t a “nice to have.” \n\nIt’s the difference between an organisation that moves fast with confidence and one that struggles with security gaps, inconsistent environments, and operational friction.\n\nHere’s a \"short\" sales pitch why a cloud foundation matters:\n\n🔒 Security by Default\nA well‑designed foundation enforces guardrails from day 1; identity, networking, logging, encryption, governance. Instead of reacting to risks, teams start from a secure baseline and build upward.\n\n🎯 Consistency Across Environments\nWhen environments are created through standardised landing zone templates and policies, you avoid configuration drift. Dev, test, and production behave predictably, lowering operational risk and simplifying troubleshooting.\n\n⚙️ Scalability & Automation\nA cloud foundation forces automation-first practices: Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, micro‑segmented networks, and controlled service enablement. This turns the cloud into a repeatable, scalable platform instead of a collection of hand-crafted setups.\n\n📉 Reduced Cost & Waste\nClear governance and cost controls, from budgets to approved services, keep cloud spend intentional rather than accidental. A good foundation doesn’t limit innovation; it channels it efficiently.\n\n👩‍💻 Empowered Teams\nWhen platform capabilities and boundaries are clear, teams can innovate faster. Developers get safe sandbox environments, product teams get clarity on what they can deploy, and security teams get full visibility and trust in the setup.\n\n🌍 Compliance Made Achievable\nWhether it’s data residency, auditing, or identity standards, a cloud foundation transforms compliance from a manual burden into an automated design principle.\n\nA cloud foundation isn't just an IT construct, it's an accelerator for innovation, resilience, and trust.\n\n#cloudfoundation #cloudsecurity #cloudresilience #compliance #zerotrust #automation #iac #infrastructureascode",

        "text": "You can’t have accountability when decisions are delegated to committees. \n\nCommittees can’t be held liable, can’t be held accountable, as they don’t own or live with consequences of decisions.\n\nWhy do companies so often default to committee-based decision-making?\n\nThe answer isn’t simple malice or incompetence. \n\nIt’s often a well-intentioned response to complex problems:\n\n1. Risk Diffusion: \n\nIn risk-averse cultures, a committee spreads the blame, creating a perceived safety net. It’s a mechanism for shared organizational protection, however misguided.\n\n2. The Illusion of Buy-in: \n\nGathering multiple stakeholders seems like a way to ensure alignment and smoother implementation. The decision may be weaker, but the path to execution appears less rocky.\n\n3. Handling Cross-Functional Complexity: \n\nWhen a decision impacts Sales, Marketing, Product, and Finance, who really has \"skin in the game\"? The committee becomes a proxy for the enterprise's collective skin.\n\nBut this comes at a massive cost: slowed velocity, diluted ownership, and mediocre outcomes. \n\nThe committee’ primary incentive shifts from \"get it right\" to \"avoid getting it wrong.\"\n\nSo, what's the alternative?\n\nWe shouldn’t abolish committees entirely, but we must redefine their role. \n\nThey should be used for consultation ONLY, not for decision. \n\nTheir input is vital, but the decision itself must be placed squarely with a named individual.\n\nThat individual must have the authority, resources, and, critically, the responsibility for the outcome. \n\nThey have the \"skin in the game.\"\n\nLeaders: your job is to design decision-rights frameworks that mandate single-point accountability. \n\nUse committees as advisory boards. \n\nUse RASCI charts to clarify roles. \n\nReward decisive ownership, even when it leads to occasional failures, more than you reward flawed consensus.\n\nBecause in the end, a single throat to choke is also a single back to pat. \n\nThat’s where innovation, speed, and true accountability live.\n\n#Accountability #DecisionMaking #Management #CorporateCulture #Execution #SkinInTheGame",

        "text": "You see the red flag 🚩, but the team doesn’t wave it. Why?\n\nOne would think having a member of the team not performing or just not conforming as well as the rest would send off immediate red flags to the manager. \n\nOver the years, I’ve noticed that the flags are all but immediate or very clear.\n\nThe team often steps in, overcompensating for the lack of performance, hoping the team member in question would notice and \"come to their senses.\" \n\nThis behavior stems from our nature as social beings, where the desire for group harmony often overrides individual accountability. \n\nThis makes it harder for a manager to course-correct early, rather than later when negative patterns are entrenched. \n\nThis isn't a failure of the team, but a natural human tendency that requires proactive leadership to navigate.\n\nResearch into team dynamics gives us the language for what we intuitively observe. \n\nWhat I've called \"hoping they'll come to their senses\" often manifests as \"groupthink\" - where the drive for consensus and harmony leads to suppressing concerns and avoiding healthy conflict. \n\nA team’s \"cohesiveness,\" while usually positive, can become a liability if it prioritizes \"we-ness\" over addressing performance gaps.\n\nThe cost of this quiet compensation is steep: reduced overall productivity, decreased morale, burnout for high performers, and even increased turnover as your best people seek healthier environments.\n\nMy experience is that the manager needs to observe team dynamics continuously, ask probing questions, and stay on top of team health to catch outliers early. \n\nThis is constant work. Just because a team reaches a \"performing\" state doesn't mean it will stay there. New members, changed conditions, and external pressures all shift the dynamics.\n\nStaying present, inquisitive, and available are the key characteristics of a leader who can steer through all types of waters. This isn't micromanagement; it's about creating the conditions for sustainable success.\n\nThe most functional teams aren't those without problems; they are the ones with the trust, tools, and leadership to address problems openly and early.\n\n#TeamLeadership #Management #TeamDynamics #PsychologicalSafety #HighPerformingTeams #PeopleManagement #LeadershipDevelopment",

More on that later.\n \nFor the next two months, I’ll be wrapping up, handing over, and of course, enjoying as many Thursday pancakes as possible.\n \n#SEB #CloudJourney #LifeatSEB #SEBCloud #SEBTech #DigitalTransformation #FinTech #Gratitude #CareerMove #PlatformEngineering #ZeroTrust #Compliance #Teamwork #NextChapter",

        "text": "In our current era of engineered contentment and digital distraction, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World feels less like speculative fiction and more like a diagnostic manual for the modern age. \n\nPublished in 1932, its central question; wheater perpetual, superficial happiness is worth the sacrifice of human depth, resonates with unsettling precision today. \n\nFrom the potent symbolism of Shakespeare, wielded by the so-called \"savage,\" Huxley crafts a timeless critique of a society that trades free thought, tragedy, and truth for a painless, preordained stability.\n\nThe novel’s richest conflict manifests in the character of John, raised on a \"Savage Reservation.\" \n\nTo the \"civilized\" World State, he is a primitive curiosity. \n\nYet, he alone possesses a deep education in the works of Shakespeare, the pinnacle of Western literary civilization. \n\nHis exclamation, \"O brave new world, That has such people in't!\" borrowed from Miranda in The Tempest, is initially uttered in awe but soon curdles into bitter irony as he witnesses the emotional and spiritual poverty beneath the society's shiny veneer.\n\nThis reversal is the novel's masterstroke. \n\nThe \"savage\" becomes the sole vessel for art, passion, and profound emotion, all qualities systematically eradicated from the \"civilized\" world in the name of efficiency and control. \n\nThe \"civilization\" of the World State is built on biological engineering, psychological conditioning, and the abolition of history, family, and diversity. \n\nTrue \"civilization,\" as demonstrated by the cultural heritage in Shakespeare's plays, is preserved only among the \"savages.\" \n\nJohn’s identity is forged by Othello, Hamlet, and Romeo and Juliet, plays that explore jealousy, grief, and passionate love, all intense, \"unhappy\" emotions the World State has pharmacologically and socially eliminated.\n\nThe World State’s stability relies on hypnopaedia (sleep-teaching) and neo-Pavlovian conditioning to mold perfect, compliant citizens. \n\nFree, critical, or individualistic thought is the system's greatest enemy. \n\nThe genius of Brave New World is that its dystopia is not built on boots and torture chambers, but on pleasure, convenience, and instant gratification. \n\nThe drug soma is the ultimate tool of control, offering \"a holiday from the facts\". \n\nToday, we might see its analogues in the endless scroll of social media, algorithmically curated content, and the constant pursuit of optimized living.\n\nThe World State’s mantra of \"Community, Identity, Stability\" is achieved by erasing individual identity and artistic complexity. \n\nIn an age where uncomfortable emotions are often met with medication or digital distraction rather than introspection or art, Huxley’s warning is prescient: a world that seeks to eliminate all hardships may eliminate what makes us profoundly human.\n\nThe novel challenges us to ask: In our pursuit of a smooth, successful, and \"happy\" life, are we conditioning ourselves to accept a shallower existence? \n\n#bravenewworld",

        "text": "Putting \"agile fatigue\" into context...\n\nI've heard many leaders talk about \"agile fatigue\" recently, and I want to place it in a broader context. In business, there are always a handful of trends unfolding in parallel. They arrive in waves that take roughly 10–15 years to form, crest, break, and then recede. Some examples:\n\n-Globalization and offshoring (late 1970s–early 2000s)\n-Shareholder primacy and financialization (1980s–2000s)\n-Lean and process optimization (1990s–2010s)\n-Agile and digital transformation (mid-2000s–early 2020s)\n-AI and automation (late 2010s–present)\n\nWithin these waves are often sub-waves, niche waves, etc. For example, in the startup niche you see other waves:\n\n-Lean startup and MVP movement (late 2000s–mid 2010s)\n-Growth hacking and hyper-scaling playbooks (early–late 2010s)\n-Venture-fueled blitzscaling (mid 2010s–early 2020s)\n-Product-led growth as the default go-to-market model (late 2010s–present)\n-AI-native startups and toolchain rebuilding (early 2020s–present)\n\nOr the mini-wave set of:\n\n-Early team-level agile replacing plan-driven delivery (mid-1990s–early 2010s)\n-Scaling frameworks (early–mid 2010s)\n-Design thinking and UX practices (mid-2010s)\n-DevOps and internal platforms (late 2010s)\n-Value streams, lean portfolio management, and team topologies (late 2010s–early 2020s)\n-Product operating models (early 2020s–present)\n\nWith every wave, consultancies brew up offerings, co-opt (and hire) from the early majority, sell to the late majority, and eventually make tons of money from the \"laggards.\" The major consultancies began embracing and commercializing Agile well after the methods had become mainstream in tech, roughly in the early to mid-2010s (around 2012–2018). The pull? Enterprises seeking scaled, enterprise-wide agile transformation services.\n\n-Scaling frameworks emerged around 2011–2012.\n-By the mid-2010s, enterprise agile transformation became a distinct category of consulting offerings (large banks, etc.).\n-Major strategy and technology consultancies published agile research and formalized transformation practices by around 2018, reflecting the peak of enterprise agile demand and mainstream adoption.\n\nFatigue develops when a generation of executives and leaders have heard the same pitches over and over from the same group of consultancies, and eventually ask the sensible question: \"OK, show me the results.\"\n\nThe agile community's default answer has often been, \"But you never embraced the principles!\" But the damage from enterprise offerings, sadly, has already been done, which naturally sends people off looking for other answers.\n\nSo whether the fatigue is warranted or not, the damage has been done.\n\nThe silver lining is that the really important ideas have taken hold. They aren’t packageable, but they have permeated how things get done, and what people strive to emulate and achieve.\n\nNext it will be product operating model fatigue...\n\nAnd \"AI operating model\" fatigue....",

Martin is worth your time. \n\nThe book delivers a clear, actionable framework for making tough strategic choices. \n\nHowever, it often reads like a case study of P&G’s operating model, which is both a strength and a limitation.\n\nThe book’s central premise is that strategy is choice. \n\nIt’s not a plan or a vision, but a set of integrated, deliberate decisions about what to do and, crucially, what not to do. \n\nThe authors introduce the “Strategic Choice Cascade,” a five-question sequence that forces clarity:\n\n1. Winning Aspiration: What does “winning” truly look like?\n\n2. Where to Play: Which markets, segments, and geographies will you focus on (and where will you not play)?\n\n3. How to Win: What unique value proposition will allow you to beat competitors there?\n\n4. Capabilities Required: What distinctive skills, activities, and systems are needed to deliver on your “how to win”?\n\n5. Management Systems: What structures, processes, and metrics will support and measure execution?\n\nThis cascade is a powerful tool for cutting through strategic ambiguity. \n\nThe book reinforces that a modest aspiration often leads to mediocrity, while focus, born from clear choices, is a crucial winning attribute.\n\nThe book also identifies six common strategy traps, which indicate fundamental flaws in strategic thinking. \n\n- The Do-It-All Strategy: Trying to pursue every opportunity, making everything a priority, and diluting resources. This is the core failure to make explicit choices.\n\n- The Something-for-Everyone Strategy: Attempting to capture all customer, channel, or geographic segments at once, resulting in a muddled value proposition.\n\n - The Don Quixote Strategy: Attacking the strongest competitor head-on in their core market (\"walled cities\") without a realistic chance to win.\n\n- The Waterloo Strategy: Starting conflicts on multiple fronts with multiple competitors simultaneously, guaranteeing a losing battle.\n\n- The Dreams-That-Never-Come-True Strategy: Having lofty mission statements that never translate into concrete choices about where to play, how to win, or the required capabilities and systems.\n\n- The Program-of-the-Month Strategy: Constantly shifting initiatives or settling for a generic industry strategy that makes you indistinguishable from competitors.\n\n“Playing to Win” is a valuable read for executives and strategists in established, product-driven companies who need a disciplined approach to focus and resource allocation. \n\nHowever, entrepreneurs, digital innovators, or those in highly fluid industries may find the examples less recognisable. For them, the book is best read as a primer on strategic logic rather than a literal playbook.\n\n#Strategy #BookReview #PlayingToWin #BusinessStrategy #ProcterAndGamble #RogerMartin #AGLafley",

        "text": "A number of years ago, in a new role, I was trying to understand our goals. \n\nI asked a colleague two simple questions: \n\n\"Who do we benchmark our progress against? How do we know if we're doing better or worse?\"\n\nHis reply was instinctive and, on the surface, logical: \"We benchmark our progress against our closest competitors.\" \n\nHe meant other similarly-sized companies in our industry, selling similar things to similar audiences.\n\nMy response caught him off guard: \n\n\"Ah, so we're benchmarking against other dinosaurs. As I recall, all dinosaurs died out at the same time.\"\n\nHe was understandably taken aback, so I had to explain.\n\nWhat I meant was this: \n\nbenchmarking solely against your immediate industry rivals is a form of strategic myopia. \n\nIt ensures you're only ever incrementally better, or worse, within a paradigm that may itself be heading for extinction. \n\nYou learn to run faster in a race that might be irrelevant, while completely missing the meteor headed your way - the disruptor from another sector, the shifting customer behavior, the new business model that redefines \"value.\"\n\nThe real question isn't just \"Are we better than our competitors?\" \n\nIt's \"Are we creating value for the customers we have, and the customers we want to have?\"\n\nInstead of just looking sideways at your direct competitors, you must:\n\n1. Look Forward: \n\nBenchmark against the companies winning in the customer segments you aspire to serve.\n\n2. Look Sideways: \n\nBenchmark against companies renowned for excellence in a specific function you're transforming (e.g., benchmark your logistics against Amazon, your customer service against Disney, your design against Apple).\n\n3. Look at the Outcome: \n\nCustomers don't compare you just to your industry. They compare their experience with you to their last best experience with any company. Is your digital onboarding as smooth as your customer's favorite app? Is your service as empathetic as a great hotel chain?\n\nThe goal isn't to be the best-looking dinosaur in the valley. \n\nIt's to evolve your company and the people in it, into something that thrives in the new reality.\n\nThe only way to win is to be better, not by settling for \"slightly better than our closest competitors,\" but by being objectively excellent in the eyes of the people that matter most: your (future) customers.\n\nHow do you avoid \"dinosaur benchmarking\"? \n\nWho do you look to outside your industry for inspiration?\n\n#Leadership #Strategy #DigitalTransformation #Innovation #BusinessStrategy #CompetitiveAdvantage #GrowthMindset",

        "text": "I just finished listening to Orwell’s ’1984’. As dystopian books go, this is the ultimate reference on dystopia.\n\nIts power isn’t just in its bleakness, but in its chilling familiarity. \n\nOrwell gives us an incredibly dark world of eternal wars between three hemispheres, one-party rule that cannot be questioned, and disinformation and surveillance abound.\n\nThe protagonist, Winston Smith, begins a silent rebellion in his own head. \n\nAgainst the party, society, and Big Brother, he stumbles upon the love of his life, Julia. \n\nIn this horrendous world of rations, doublespeak, and hate weeks, a spark ignites in his body and soul.\n\nTheir rebellion is intimacy itself. \n\nIn a place where, as Orwell writes, “The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better,” they choose freedom. \n\nOnly briefly.\n\nAs they are inevitably caught, the only thing keeping Winston through torture is the idea of her. \n\nHe doesn’t fully cave until he’s forced to confront his greatest fear. \n\nIn the end, after their release, they meet - broken, physically and mentally, robbed of the last bright thing they clung to.\n\nHe no longer could love her. \n\nInstead “He loved Big Brother.” \n\nIt’s definitely not a happy book. \n\nBut that’s why it feels all the more pressing today. \n\nIt’s less a prophecy and more a stark, eternal warning about the mechanics of power: autocratic rulers, polarized thoughts, divided societies, and the erosion of truth.\n\nThe book’s final terror isn’t just the triumph of the state, but the systematic dismantling of the human spirit - the victory of a power that demands not just obedience, but sincere, unquestioning love for one’s own oppression.\n\nAll the more today, 1984 remains the ultimate primer on the absolute extremes of unchecked control. \n\nIt asks the question we must continually answer: \n\nwhat are we willing to see, to say, and to remember?\n\n#Orwell #NineteenEightyFour #Dystopia #CriticalThinking #Literature",

        "text": "Remember the '90s, dial-up modems, and the brilliant chaos of Westwood’s Command & Conquer Red Alert?\n\nFor a strategy buff like me, it was a perfect balance of play: the powerhouse Soviets with their temperamental super-weapons, the high-tech Americans, and the exotic, futuristic Europeans. \n\nThree distinct factions, shifting alliances, and a tense, even-matched stalemate. It was a fantastic diversion.\n\nToday, that fictional world feels less like a pastime and more like a disconcerting mirror. \n\nThe clear, ideological divisions of the 20th century have fragmented into a new, fluid landscape of hemispheric influence. \n\nThe old, often steadfast loyalties are increasingly replaced by a transactional, opportunistic mindset. \n\nIt’s a global arena where today’s ally can be tomorrow’s adversary, and principles can seem secondary to pragmatic deals.\n\nIt’s hard not to recall Orwell’s 1984, not for its surveillance state alone, but for its chilling depiction of perpetual, realigned conflict. \n\nOceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia in a constant dance of shifting hostilities and convenient pacts: “The enemy of my enemy is my friend” until they aren’t. \n\nOrwell wrote of a world where “the war is not meant to be won, but to be continuous.” \n\nWhile we’re not there, the specter of continuous, managed rivalry, fought in economic, cyber, and informational spheres, feels more plausible than it has in decades.\n\nThis isn’t just a theoretical concern for hobbyists. \n\nIt’s the framework of the world we are building now, and the one we will leave to the next generation. \n\nThe question it forces upon us is profound: in a landscape defined by transaction over trust, and influence over alliance, how do we anchor our shared humanity and collective security?\n\nAs Yeats warned in another era, “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.” \n\nIt feels imperative that in our professional spheres, whether in tech, policy, business, or education, we champion the “centre”: the enduring values of transparency, genuine partnership, and long-term stability over short-term gain.\n\nBecause the game we’re now in has no power off button.\n\n#Geopolitics #Future #Strategy #History  #CommandAndConquer #GlobalAffairs #NextGeneration #Reflection",

This way, project budgets can be scrutinized and some of the duplication reduced.\n\nThis does not mean platform usage is mandated (in most cases it should not), but it'd level the playing field.",

        "text": "Embracing Change in IT: How to \"Kill Your Darlings\" Without Casualties\n\nWe’ve all been there. \n\nIn IT, our “darlings” aren’t just personal preferences; they’re deeply held convictions about say Linux distros, Kubernetes flavors, cloud providers, or observability stacks. \n\nThey represent expertise, invested time, and often, professional identity.\n\nSo, how do you lead a change or consolidation journey when it requires people to rethink and relinquish these ”darlings”?\n\nIt’s one of the hardest parts of transformation.\n\nRecently discussed this, and my take is that you can’t just mandate a “better” tool or platform. \n\nThe goal isn’t to win an argument, but to build shared understanding.\n\nA method that usually works is to move the conversation from opinion to collective evaluation. \n\nAs a team:\n\n1. List all options (the incumbent darling included).\n\n2. Collectively define the criteria that matter most now; cost, scalability, security, skill availability, future roadmap etc. \n\n3. Weight those criteria based on strategic goals.\n\n4. Evaluate objectively against the weighted framework.\n\nThis process isn’t about proving someone wrong. \n\nIt’s about transparently aligning on what “right” looks like for the organization going forward. \n\nNot everyone will walk away in full agreement, but they can understand why the decision was made. \n\nThe respect and inclusivity of the process builds the psychological safety needed to adopt the change.\n\nUltimately, killing darlings isn’t about destruction; it’s about making room for what serves the team and mission best today. \n\nAnd sometimes, the most important consolidation isn’t of tools, but of perspectives.\n\n#ChangeManagement #ITLeadership #DigitalTransformation #TechStrategy #DevOps #TeamCollaboration #KillYourDarlings",

        "text": "Just finished Chris Miller’s ”Chip War - The Fight For The World’s Most Critical Technology”, and it’s a book that lingers. \n\nIt's a gripping historical time-lapse of the integrated circuit, its pioneers, and its pivotal moments. \n\nWhile written with an American worldview, it offers a sobering look at how silicon became the bedrock of modern power.\n\nThe core lesson is that chips are the ultimate power differentiator. \n\nThe book traces how Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan rose by embracing American and European know-how, perfecting it, and eventually leapfrogging their mentors. \n\nConversely, the Soviet Union, perpetually a few years behind, lost the arms race partly due to its inability to master chipmaking.\n\nToday, this battle centers on Taiwan and China. \n\n🇹🇼Taiwan's TSMC isn't just a company; it's a geopolitical linchpin. Consider its staggering dominance:\n\n- Market Power: TSMC holds over 70% of the global foundry market.\n\n- Technology Lead: It produces 92% of the world's most advanced chips and just began mass production of cutting-edge 2nm chips.\n\n- Global Dependence: It supplies everything from Apple's iPhones to Nvidia's AI processors.\n\nMeanwhile, China, as Miller details, has poured billions into achieving \"silicon independence,\" with mixed results. \n\nDespite massive investment, its self-sufficiency goals remain unmet, and its top foundry, SMIC, holds only a 5.1% market share.\n\nThis brings us to the critical question: \n\nDoes TSMC's dominance act as a \"Silicon Shield\" for Taiwan?\n\nThe theory is compelling. \n\nWith over half of Taiwan's chip exports going to China, and a conflict potentially costing the global economy up to $10 trillion, the economic deterrent is immense. The logic is that no one, including China, would risk destroying the world's economic engine.\n\nHowever, this shield has cracks.\n\n1. Strategic Hedging: The U.S., Japan, and Europe are investing heavily to \"de-risk\" and build production elsewhere. TSMC itself is building fabs in the U.S. and elsewhere to diversify. Over time, this could dilute the immediate imperative to defend Taiwan's fabs.\n\n2. A \"Golden Egg\": Conversely, TSMC's priceless technology could be seen by Beijing not as a deterrent, but as a target, the ultimate prize to seize for ”national rejuvenation”.\n\n3. The Innovation Edge: Taiwan plans to keep manufacturing the most advanced chips on home soil to remain indispensable. But if geopolitical pressure forces a faster dispersion of this intellectual crown jewels, the shield weakens.\n\nContinued in the comments 👇\n\n#ChipWar #Semiconductors #Geopolitics #Taiwan #TSMC #Innovation #SupplyChain #Technology #BookReview",

        "text": "🇪🇺 Europe — let’s get our act together in 2026 🇪🇺\n\nWith 2025 in the rear-view mirror, it’s time to take in some of the lessons from a watershed year for the world.\n\nGeopolitics have been more prominent than at any time since 1989: the war in Ukraine, a more self-focused United States, the end of globalization as we knew it, and a European Union waking up to a world that requires us to completely rethink competitiveness.\n\nParadoxically, it is precisely Europe that may now have the greatest opportunity for renewed growth and sustained prosperity. But this will require change. We will need to recalibrate our priorities and embrace reform.\n\nFirst steps have been taken to strengthen our own security—beyond, but not without, existing alliances. This will require a fresh approach to public financing. Only economic growth can provide the resources needed without massively scaling back social welfare and climate ambitions.\n\nGrowth will only return if we unleash the full potential of 500 million well-educated, innovative Europeans — by reducing overregulation and removing non-tariff barriers that stifle development. The intentions of the new European Commission and many Member State governments point in the right direction, but they still lack concrete measures for less fragmentation and more common market.\n\nAs President of EFPIA - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations , I have the privilege of serving one of Europe’s most important and innovative industries. Our sector embodies what Europe aspires to be: creating high-quality jobs, driving innovation, strengthening industrial presence, boosting exports, and—above all—delivering better health in an ageing society.\n\nNone of this can be taken for granted. Our success cannot rely solely on favourable conditions in the US or China. Europe must strengthen its own market attractiveness for investment in innovation and industrial development. We need faster access to innovative medicines at fair prices, smarter regulation, and the right political incentives.\n\nIt is time to get our act together — and to see today’s geopolitical shifts as a unique opportunity to build a stronger, more competitive, and better Europe.",

        "text": "It’s that time of the year when people list achievements and reflections on the year gone by, on all sorts of social media. \n\nIt’s easy to get caught in the flywheel and easier still to start comparing and silently competing with everything that’s being shared.\n\nIt’s just human. \n\nIt’s one of our most basic traits; to compare ourselves to others, to compete and to imitate.\n\nWhat’s being shared, however, is not necessarily the full picture of a year gone by with all its ups and downs. \n\nIt’s rather a two-dimensional slice of a fruit, as Steve Jobs would put it, probably chosen for its looks but not reflective of the full three-dimensional fruit, with all its dimensions and flavours, both good and bad.\n\nIt’s important to remember here to be kind to oneself, refrain from comparing, and only measure against yourself: how the year prior went and whether you moved forward in your own journey, through both accomplishments and failures.\n\nWhen I, like everyone else, start reading about and comparing myself with someone else’s successes, I’m reminded of an episode ten years ago in Mallorca. \n\nI took a vacation photo of my son against the azure blue sea (the one below). \n\nAfter that perfect, posted Instagram moment, what followed was all but calm and happiness. \n\nMy son had thrown sand in his eyes and wouldn’t let us wash it out. \n\nHe was shouting in agony; we were panicking in despair. \n\nEverything was sorted eventually, but to this day, that event reminds me that social media tells a very shallow, two-dimensional version of reality.\n\nThere is so much more than meets the eye in every life story, in every feeling, in every experience, nuances that can’t be digitized or broadcast.\n\nSo my promise to myself next year is to do fewer comparisons with others, and many more with myself. \n\nAfter all, I don’t see or understand all the life nuances in others as I do in my own life story.\n\nHere’s to a 2026 focused on deeper growth, not broader validation. \n\nTo measuring progress by our own standards, and embracing the full, three-dimensional truth of our journeys.\n\nWishing You and Yours a meaningful and compassionate New Year 2026!\n\n#NewYearReflections #SelfComparison #PersonalGrowth #Mindfulness #SocialMediaAwareness\n\nP.S. Adding another picture of me and my son, now 10 years older. One of the happiest achievements this year for me has been getting the chance to share my passion for running and fitness with him. Not always easy, without conflicts or frustrations, but worth every single second, as it’s about long term investment in him and our relationship. D.S.",

Dick) and the sharp analysis from Hayden touched on a core idea: \n\nIn an age of noise and distraction, clarity is your most valuable asset.\n\nThe books I finished this year (inverse chronological order):\n\n1. The Let Them Theory - Mel Robbins\n2. The 5 Types of Wealth - Sahil Bloom\n3. 7 Rules of Power - Jeffrey Pfeffer\n4. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? - Philip K. Dick\n5.

Every time we love, every time we give, it’s Christmas\".\n\nFrom my heart to yours, I wish you a peaceful and reflective holiday. \n\nMay the new year bring more light, understanding, and humanity to us all.\n\n#Christmas #Reflection #Hope #Peace",

        "text": "Jira is a Mirror, Not the Work Itself.\n\nThroughout my career, Jira has been a constant. But I’ve never seen it as the primary place where the actual work gets done.\n\nTo me, it’s a metadata collection - a reflection of the real work that happens outside the ticket. \n\nDevelopment, ops tasks, support resolutions, incident handling, meeting users… the value is created elsewhere.\n\nIf and when possible, Jira should be fed by the systems where work is performed, and not manually by humans. Why?\n\n1. Human data entry is error-prone for various reasons. \n\n2. The more complex handling of the tickets and workflows become, the less time is spent on value-adding work, and the more time is lost by “feeding the Jira beast” with fields, labels, and process overhead.\n\nI often push back hard on unnecessary additions to a simple Jira setup. \n\nRarely do they provide real value. \n\nThey just create a more detailed shadow of reality, often at the cost of the reality itself.\n\nA great system should give insight, not impose friction. \n\nThe ticket is not the task; it’s just a signpost.\n\n“The map is not the territory.”\n\n#Jira #WaysOfWorking #Productivity #ProcessImprovement",

        "text": "You know that driving, urgent melody you're probably hearing everywhere this month? \n\nIts story is a powerful lesson in cultural resilience. 🎄🇺🇦\n\nThis isn't just a Christmas carol. \n\nIt's a Ukrainian anthem that refused to be silenced.\n\nIts journey from a folk chant to a global holiday staple is a story of identity, resistance, and hope.\n\nThe melody comes from \"Shchedryk,\" a traditional Ukrainian \"winter well-wishing\" folk song. \n\nIts lyrics celebrated a swallow heralding spring and a bountiful new year.\n\nIn 1914, in the industrial town of Pokrovsk, yes that Pokrovsk, composer Mykola Leontovych arranged the folk tune for a workers' choir. \n\nIt was first performed in Kyiv in 1916.\n\nLeontovych created \"Shchedryk\" during a time of intense political struggle. \n\nIn 1919, as Ukraine fought for independence from the nascent Soviet Union, the government had a bold idea: if they couldn't win militarily, they would win culturally.\n\nThe newly formed Ukrainian National Chorus was sent on a global diplomatic tour.\n\nTheir mission was to promote Ukraine as a sovereign nation with a unique culture. \n\n\"Shchedryk\" was a centerpiece of their program.\n\nIn 1922, they performed it at a sold-out Carnegie Hall debut, where it was called a \"marvel of technical skill\".\n\nAt that 1922 concert, American conductor Peter Wilhousky (of Ukrainian descent) heard the melody. \n\nIt reminded him of bells, so in 1936 he wrote new English lyrics, creating the \"Carol of the Bells\" we know today.\n\nLeontovych never saw this global fame. \n\nFor his role in promoting Ukrainian culture, he was assassinated by a Soviet agent in 1921. His music was declared irrelevant for the \"Soviet reality\".\n\nThe same imperial logic that sought to erase Ukrainian culture a century ago persists today. \n\nThe building in Pokrovsk where Leontovych composed \"Shchedryk\" now sits in a war zone.\n\nYet, the song endures. \n\nIt is a stunning act of cultural resistance - proof that a melody can become a banner for national identity.\n\nThis holiday season, when you hear \"Carol of the Bells,\" remember:\n\nYou're not just hearing a Christmas tune. \n\nYou're hearing the unbreakable spirit of a people. \n\nYou're hearing a swallow's promise of spring, composed in defiance, and a echo from a choir that sang for a nation's very right to exist.\n\n#StandWithUkraine #SlavaUkraini #CarolOfTheBells #Shchedryk #History",

When vendors come from countries where governments can compel access to data or networks, the security risks are obvious. And in a world where China and others increasingly align with Russia, Europe cannot afford to leave these gaps open.\n\nRight now, most Member States still haven’t fully implemented the EU’s 5G Security Toolbox, highlighting the limits of a voluntary approach. \n\n👉 I asked whether the Commission plans to make parts of the 5G Supply Chain Toolbox binding on Member States, and whether this approach will expand beyond telecoms to other critical ICT sectors.❓\n\nI warmly welcomed Commissioner Virkkunen’s message that stronger measures to protect critical infrastructure will feature in the Cybersecurity Act revision. \n\nWhat’s your view on how the EU should handle high-risk vendors?❓",

        "text": "There’s a recent narrative about the “suppression of free speech,” in #Europe when compared to the #USA.\n\nIt’s an interesting perspective given that those claiming oppression are often those resistant to listening to any views opposing their worldviews and their beliefs.\n\nAlso, those complaining about oppression of #freespeech are often those who try to suffocate, ban, or skew any ideas or points of view that do not align with their own.\n\nThis tension lies at the very heart of classical liberal philosophy. \n\nTo move past the slogans and understand the real dilemma, we must return to two thinkers: John Stuart Mill and Karl Popper.\n\nThe modern debate is framed by a crucial tension between the near-absolute defense of speech and the necessary defense of a tolerant society from those who would destroy it.\n\nIn his 1859 essay On Liberty, Mill built an overwhelming case against silencing any opinion. \n\nHis central argument, often called the \"Harm Principle,\" states that “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others”. \n\nFor Mill, offense, discomfort, or even profound disagreement does not constitute harm.\n\nWriting in the shadow of World War II in The Open Society and Its Enemies (1945), Karl Popper identified a critical limit. \n\nHe formulated the \"paradox of tolerance\": that unlimited #tolerance must logically lead to the disappearance of tolerance .\n\nPopper’s argument is nuanced and is often misused. \n\nHe did not advocate for the suppression of merely objectionable ideas. His concern was with ideologies that reject the very framework of rational debate and liberal democracy.\n\nMill's focus is on the individual's right to speak without state or social interference, based on the fallibility of human judgment and the search for truth.\n\nPopper's focus is on the society's right to survive. He argues a tolerant society must retain the right to defend itself against movements that preach intolerance and would use democratic freedoms to destroy democracy.\n\nAs Popper himself cautioned, suppression is “most unwise” as long as intolerant philosophies can be countered by rational argument and public opinion. \n\nThe line is crossed when such movements “begin by denouncing all argument” and “answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols”.\n\nLegal systems have drawn boundaries that operationalize the principles of preventing harm and protecting societal integrity.\n\nThe US approach largely aligns with Mill. Hateful speech is protected unless it falls into a narrow category like incitement. The remedy for bad speech is considered to be more speech.\n\nThe European approach is more influenced by Popperian and post-war concerns. Many European nations criminalize hate speech - the public incitement to violence or hatred based on characteristics like race, religion, or nationality - seeing it as a threat to the dignity of others and to social peace.\n\nContinued below.",

Everyone is “at capacity.” Everyone can point to a dozen tasks they completed. They can even argue those tasks were important. And in isolation, many of them were.\n\nBut restaurants are not judged by how busy the kitchen is.

        "text": "I’ve always found a deep, personal peace in gardening. \n\nThere’s something profound about planting a seed, nurturing the fragile sprout, and giving it the conditions to grow stronger each day.\n\nRecently, I realized this isn’t just a hobby - it’s the purest metaphor for leadership I know.\n\nThe best leadership, like the best gardening, is present but not overbearing. \n\nIt’s about creating a solid, fertile foundation and then being ready to support when the conditions change. \n\nYou invest effort without always knowing precisely how the harvest will turn out, adapting and trusting the process.\n\nAs Nelson Mandela reflected, “Like the gardener, a leader must take responsibility for what he cultivates”. \n\nThis responsibility isn’t about control, but about creating the right environment for growth.\n\nHere’s how the parallel unfolds in practice:\n\n1. Preparing the Soil: The Foundation of Culture\n\nYou can’t grow strong plants in weak soil, and you can’t develop strong leaders in a poor culture. \n\nJust as a gardener enriches the earth, a leader’s first job is to cultivate a foundation of psychological safety and trust. \n\nThis means asking more questions than you answer and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. \n\nIt’s the essential nutrient for growth.\n\n2. Seeding & Planting: Identifying and Positioning Potential\n\nEvery gardener knows you need the right plant for the right spot. \n\nIn leadership, this translates to spotting talent (“seeds”) that shows enthusiasm and values, and then intentionally “planting” people where they will thrive - giving them the sunlight of opportunity and challenge they need to flourish.\n\n3. Pruning & Weeding: The Courage to Focus\n\nGrowth often requires removal. \n\nPruning isn’t punishment; it’s a positive regime to direct energy to the healthiest branches. \n\nFor leaders, this means having the courage to eliminate obsolete tasks, streamline processes, or make tough people decisions to ensure the overall vitality of the team and its mission.\n\n4. Attentive Maintenance: The Daily Work of Care\n\nThe glamorous work gets attention, but gardens and teams thrive on consistent, daily care. \n\nThis is the “maintenance” of leadership: regular one-on-one conversations, providing clear feedback, skill development, and removing bureaucratic “weeds” that stifle innovation. \n\nIt’s about being attentive - truly tuned in to the needs of your people and the health of the project.\n\nUltimately, as Susan Collins noted, \n\n“Leaders are like gardeners... we are not only responsible for harvesting our own success but for cultivating the success of the next generation”.\n\nOur role isn’t to force growth. \n\nIt’s to mindfully prepare the ground, provide the right support at the right time, and have the patience to let nature - and human potential - take its course.\n\n#LeadershipDevelopment #GardeningAndLeadership #TeamBuilding #PeopleFirst #PsychologicalSafety #Management",

        "text": "Just finished Mel Robbins’ “The Let Them Theory,” and it’s a jolt of empowering clarity.\n\nIn a world obsessed with external validation and over-managing others’ perceptions, Robbins offers a liberating alternative: \n\nStop controlling. \n\nStart living.\n\nThe core idea is simple yet profound: \n\nYou can’t control what other people think, do, or feel. \n\nThe exhausting attempt to do so is a major source of our anxiety and inaction. \n\nSo, instead of trying to force, fix, or convince, you learn to “let them.” \n\nLet them think what they want. \n\nLet them be disappointed. \n\nLet them handle their own reactions. \n\nYour energy is then freed to focus on the one thing you truly can control, yourself.\n\nLet me. \n\nWhat gives this “theory” heft is how Robbins weaves it with timeless schools of thought:\n\nStoicism: The clear echo of focusing on your circle of control.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): The practice of identifying and challenging the “mind movies” we create about others’ judgments.\n\nModern Positive Psychology: The actionable framework for building resilience and self-trust.\n\nThis isn’t about apathy; it’s about agency. \n\nIt’s the ultimate playbook for anyone who feels trapped by the \"invisible audience\"; constantly viewing their choices, career, or life through the imagined lenses of others.\n\nA couple of powerful takeaways:\n\n“Your peace is more important than their opinion.”\n\nAnd as Robbins puts it: “Letting them be wrong about you is the price of your freedom.”\n\nIt’s a fast, energetic read that serves as both a permission slip and a practical manual. \n\nIf you’re ready to trade approval for authenticity and exhaustion for execution, this is your next read.\n\n#TheLetThemTheory #MelRobbins #PersonalDevelopment #Mindset #Leadership #Stoicism #CBT #BookReview #SelfHelp #Empowerment",

        "text": "Europe regulated itself out of the tech game a decade ago. For far too long, we treated regulation as our flagship export, and that’s precisely where we went wrong. ‼️\n\n👉🏻 I strongly reject the notion that regulation is the best thing the EU has to offer. Europe’s competitive edge will never come from producing more rules. It will come from enabling innovation, talent, and companies to thrive here rather than elsewhere. \n\n👉🏻 A crucial part of this conversation is understanding the difference between personal data and non-personal behavior and metadata. Personal data must, without question, be protected. That is a cornerstone of European values, and it should remain so. But when it comes to anonymous behavior and metadata, the EU has become far too cautious, to the point of undermining our own technological progress.\n\n👉🏻 European companies urgently need access to metadata. Policymakers need to understand that it is an essential raw material for all AI testing, training, and deployment. If we continue treating data as a risk rather than an opportunity, we will only deepen our dependency on external technologies and lose the momentum to shape global standards ourselves.\n\nEurope has the talent, the ambition, and the capacity to lead. What we need is an open, harmonized and enabling market, and courage to create a regulatory environment that empowers innovation instead of stifling it. It’s time to shift from fear to forward motion. ☝🏻",

        "text": "I bought a NATO cap a couple of weeks back when I was in #Berlin with my family. \n\nI was at the #CheckpointCharlie museum giftshop when this cap caught my eye. \n\nA couple of years ago I would probably not have given it a second glance, but this time it felt right.\n\nI was met by loud protests from the female members of the family, not against the cap or what it stands for, but more worried I’d upset someone while wearing it. \n\nHonestly, time for delicacy has since long passed. \n\nNATO, and even more importantly the pan-#European cooperation in all aspects, is paramount for ensuring continued stability, safety and prosperity of our societies and the world as a whole. \n\nThis is especially true in the current geopolitical climate where autocratic powers seek to undermine the pinnacles of a rules-based world order, individual freedoms, free thought and free speech.\n\nStanding in Berlin, you are standing on ground zero of the #ColdWar. \n\nThe city was not just a symbol of division, but the very catalyst for the alliance whose logo I now wear on the cap. \n\nIn 1948, just three years after the end of World War II, a war that left approximately 36,5 million Europeans dead and cities in ruins, the Soviet Union blockaded all rail, road, and canal access to the Western-controlled sectors of Berlin.\n\nThey hoped to force the Allies out. \n\nInstead, the West responded with the Berlin Airlift, a massive 11-month operation that flew in life-saving supplies, with a plane landing every 30 seconds at the height of the campaign. \n\nIt was a strong evidence of commitment and resolve. \n\nAs one US general noted at the time, remaining in Berlin was seen as \"essential to our prestige... a symbol of the American intent\".\n\nThe success of the airlift solidified the West's resolve. \n\nWithin months, on 4 April 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed, creating NATO. \n\nIts founding was not solely a military reaction to the Soviet Union, but a broader effort to \"deter Soviet expansionism, forbid the revival of nationalist militarism in Europe... and encourage European political integration\". \n\nThe principle at its heart is Article 5: \"an armed attack against one... shall be considered an attack against them all\". \n\nThis principle has ensured the collective defence that has secured #peace for generations.\n\nThe words of Dwight D. #Eisenhower, NATO's first Supreme Allied Commander, ring as true today as they did in 1954: \n\n\"We do not keep security establishments merely to defend property or territory or rights abroad or at sea. We keep the security forces to defend a way of life\".\n\nThat is what this cap represents to me. \n\nIt's not a provocative symbol, but a commitment to the way of life built on those principles of liberty, democracy, and cooperation that were so fiercely defended in the streets of Berlin and have ensured our safety and prosperity ever since.\n\nI will wear it with pride.\n\n#NATO #CollectiveDefence #EuropeanSecurity #BerlinHistory #Geopolitics #TransatlanticAlliance",

        "text": "My journey into #agile started about 10 years ago, roughly at the same time as I took on managing my company’s #continuousdelivery team. \n\nPrior to that, I had been a subject matter expert for our many integrations, working closely with customers, business stakeholders, development, and infrastructure teams. \n\nI had witnessed on my own skin, so to say, the drawbacks of a \"throw it over the wall\" mindset between departments and teams.\n\nI immersed myself in the #principles, attending #conferences, consuming literature, and always replying to the annual #DORA survey to benchmark our progress.\n\nThe agile journeys between different companies and industries are all different but generally follow a few common patterns. \n\nAn initial \"all-in\" approach, soon replaced with sombreness and contextualisation, and later, if the journey has gone well, fully embedded within the fabrics of the company.\n\nSometimes, companies employ different frameworks like #SAFe, #LeSS, or even a scaled #Scrum to bridge the gap between current and future state, hoping it might ensure a smoother transition.\n\nHowever, here lies the danger, in my view.\n\nWhen agile frameworks are no longer seen as voluntary but prescriptive, one of the core tenants of agile is lost on the altar of standardisation and common recognition: \n\n👉 the ability to adapt ways of working to fit the context and constraints in any given situation.\n\nIt’s easy to forget the powerful, simple words of the #AgileManifesto’s final principle: \n\n\"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\"\n\nThis isn't a suggestion to be followed only until a framework is in place. \n\nIt's the very heart of agility. \n\nAs Dave Snowden of the #Cynefin #framework famously said, \n\n\"You cannot impose order; you can only disturb the balance and see what emerges.\" \n\nImposing a rigid framework is an attempt to impose order on a complex, human system. \n\nIt might look neat on a PowerPoint slide, but it often stifles the very innovation and adaptability we seek.\n\nThus, restricting #agility brings unwillingly back the very thing that agile was supposed to do away with: #rigidness and #inflexibility. \n\nThe goal was never to be \"Agile\" with a capital 'A'. \n\nThe goal was, and is, to be agile i.e. #responsive, #adaptive, and delivering value faster. \n\nSometimes that means a team needs to drop a #ceremony, modify a #ritual, or even abandon a framework element that isn't working for them.\n\nTrue agility isn't about following a map; it's about being a skilled navigator, able to read the terrain and change course when needed.\n\n#Agile #AgileTransformation #BusinessAgility #Scrum #SAFe #Lean #ContinuousDelivery #DevOps #Leadership",

        "text": "👆 Europe is finally treating defence as a strategic responsibility. If Europe wants to lead in defence innovation, we need rules that reward speed, excellence and European technological leadership. ❗\n\nYesterday published the Defence Readiness Roadmap with four flagship capability projects, and the new Military Mobility Package are two important steps for Europe’s security and industrial resilience. \n\n👉 Excellence must guide European defence policy. Defence funding must follow strategic logic, not political distribution formulas. Europe needs an excellence based approach across its defence technology and industrial ecosystem. The principle should be clear: European first. If Europeans finance our security, European industry should benefit.\n\n📌 Threat levels are not equal. Countries closest to conventional military risk must be prioritised. Protecting the Eastern flank protects the whole Union. This is also what I am driving as Rapporteur for the Defence Readiness Omnibus in the European Parliament.\n\n📌 The European Drone Defence Initiative, the Eastern Flank Watch, the European Air Shield and the European Space Shield must move forward on a clear timeline and contribute directly to NATO capability targets. Credible deterrence cannot wait.\n\n❗Schengen for defence is at the core of fast military mobility. Europe cannot defend itself if troops and equipment are stopped at borders. The new Military Mobility Package proposes two things.\n\n👉 First, for military transport operations, a border crossing would be possible within 72 hours after the receiving Member State has received a notification. \n\n👉 Second, a fast crisis framework for priority military movement across the Union, with single contact points and shared transport capacity, would enable the Council to approve a year-long derogation for military mobility in only 48 hours. This is essential for reinforcing our Eastern flank as the United States reduces its permanent footprint.\n\nUkraine continues to demonstrate how agility and technological innovation shape the modern battlefield, and Europe must learn from that reality. That is why Europe must scale innovation procurement, support dual use development and improve access to finance, so that our startups and industry can deliver the capabilities needed for credible deterrence and for the defence of our Eastern flank.",

Examples included:\n\n ✅ Insist on doing everything through “#channels”\n ✅ Refer all matters to #committees for “further study”\n ✅ Talk at length about irrelevant issues during #meetings\n\nSound familiar? \n\nThese tactics were designed to grind wartime organizations to a halt - and yet, decades later, they perfectly describe the behaviors that slow down modern businesses.\n\nLesson? Whether you’re leading a team or transforming an enterprise, #agility and #clarity aren’t just buzzwords - they’re antidotes to sabotage.\n\n📜 Fun fact: The manual was declassified in 2008 and is freely available online. It’s a fascinating read if you want to see how timeless #bureaucracy can be!\n\n#CIA #enterprise #culture #sabotage #productivity #agile #lean",

        "text": "Security isn't a destination; it's a relentless, high-stakes race. \n\nIn the world of cybersecurity, resting on your laurels is the single greatest risk. \n\nBelieving your current defenses will be sufficient in six months or a year isn't just naive - it's reckless.\n\nWhy? Because the bad actors aren’t taking a break. \n\nThey are innovating, automating, and collaborating. \n\nTo stay ahead, we must continuously push the technological boundaries and move the goalpost forward.\n\nBut here’s the real-world dilemma for most companies: this is incredibly difficult. \n\nYou can’t just rip and replace core systems every time a new threat emerges. These implementations have multi-year lifecycles, and business continuity is paramount.\n\nSo, what’s the answer? \n\nLeave the fantasy of an impenetrable, single-layered perimeter.\n\nEmbrace Security in Depth: The Strategy of Layered Defense.\n\nThe goal isn't to have every layer be the absolute cutting-edge. \n\nThe goal is to have enough robust, overlapping layers so that when one is bypassed, the next one is waiting.\n\nThink of it like a castle:\n\n- The moat (Firewalls, Fine-Grained Network Segmentation)\n\n- The high walls (Endpoint Detection and Response - EDR)\n\n- The gatekeepers (Multi-Factor Authentication - MFA)\n\n- The guards on the walls (Security Monitoring & SIEM)\n\n- The inner keep (Data Encryption & Access Controls)\n\nAn intruder might cross the moat and scale the walls, but they will be detected, slowed, and stopped long before they reach the crown jewels.\n\nLook at the recent wave of ransomware attacks. \n\nOften, the initial breach isn't a zero-day exploit. \n\nIt's a phishing email that bypasses one layer. \n\nWithout subsequent layers, like strict user permissions, application allow-listing, or segregated backups, that single point of failure leads to a full-scale compromise.\n\nAs the legendary security expert Bruce Schneier aptly said:\n\n\"Security is a process, not a product.\"\n\nThis process is about building a resilient, layered system. \n\nIt’s about assuming breaches will happen and designing your defenses to contain the damage.\n\nYour Action Plan:\n\n1. Conduct a Layered Audit: Map your security controls. \n\n2. Prioritize foundational hygiene: Often, the biggest gains come from perfecting the basics, ie patch management, MFA enforcement, and principle of least privilege.\n\n3. Focus on Detection & Response: Invest in capabilities that help you identify and contain a threat after it has breached your perimeter.\n\nStaying ahead isn't about having the one \"unbreakable\" system. \n\nIt's about building a dynamic, layered defense that ensures an intruder’s journey is so difficult and noisy that they are either stopped or you find them before they succeed.\n\n#CyberSecurity #DefenseInDepth #CyberResilience #SecurityStrategy #ZeroTrust \n\nPS Castel Sant'Angelo has had many dramatic security layer changes. From Mausoleum to Papal Fortress to Prison and to Castle. One can literally see these layers of history stacked on top of each other. DS",

        "text": "The Commission will publish next week its Digital Omnibus - what can we expect: 💡\n\nIn general, it’s positive that the Commission seems to be following through with its commitment to simplification and is willing to address mistakes. The leaked Digital Omnibus looks like a chance to deliver targeted fixes and is a test of whether we can turn a jungle of rules into a framework that actually supports European innovation, jobs and security.\n\n☝️ The question is whether the Council and the Parliament will use it to enable European companies to grow, rather than add yet another layer of complexity.\n\n☝️ Deregulation, as in removing unnecessary, overlapping or confusing obligations is essential for competitiveness, growth and security. But any “simplification” must not create new uncertainty for those trying to comply.\n\n📌 On the GDPR, clarifying possibilities for data use for AI training with appropriate safeguards is welcome. Reopening the GDPR is a bold move; the real battle will be around Articles 4, 6 and 9. If almost everything continues to be linked to personal data, Europe will struggle to use data at scale to train its own technologies.\n\n📌 On the AI Act Omnibus, the unresolved “stop the clock” question has itself become a source of uncertainty. Companies should not be sanctioned for non-compliance with rules that are not technically and legally clear. Next week the Commission needs to provide a clearly defined pause. ❗️\n\n📌 One EU-level sandbox is a good idea and should go further, replacing 27 fragmented national approaches. Not aligning sectoral rules with the AI Act is a missed opportunity and goes against the goal of increasing AI uptake and “applying AI”.\n\n📌 Data Act consolidation and targeted updates to the other three laws can be useful, but must not become a lifeline for four flawed proposals by simply merging them. Fully repealing all four and using a proper digital fitness check in 2026 may still be the better way.\n\n📌 Single-entry-point incident reporting is positive if also paired with streamlined reporting for businesses and sufficient resources for ENISA.\n\n☝️ Finally, withdrawing the stalled CSAM proposal would signal seriousness about fixing, not doubling down on, bad ideas. ❗️\n\n#KillTheChatControlForGood\n\n#digital #data #digitalomnibus #GDPR #ChatControl #CSAM",

Edwards Deming\n\nI'm a firm believer that a data-informed culture isn't just about the tools; it's about curiosity and the relentless pursuit of the 'why' behind the numbers.\n\n#DataDriven #DataAnalytics #BigQuery #BusinessIntelligence #Leadership #ProductManagement #Cloud #DataStorytelling #SEB #SEBTech #SEBCloud",

(Either from Anibal Wainstein or Erik Schön, don’t recall who now.). \n\nAsking \"why?\" five times for each problem moved us beyond reactive firefighting into the realm of continuous and very deliberate improvements. \n\nI have kept the method with me ever since, and been using it for both personal and professional ”root cause analysis”.\n\nIt’s a technique that feels almost instinctual, but it’s interesting to know it has a proud heritage. \n\nThe Five Whys technique was developed in the 1930s by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries. \n\nIt was born on the manufacturing floor, not in a conference room, as a core component of the Toyota Production System. \n\nIts power lies in its simplicity - by repeatedly asking \"why,\" you peel back the layers of symptoms to reveal the underlying systemic cause, which is often surprisingly far removed from the initial problem.  \n\nLet's take a common scenario: a critical application is experiencing intermittent slowdowns for users.\n\n1. Why is the application responding slowly?\n\nMonitoring shows the database server is experiencing very high CPU utilization.\n\n2. Why is the database server CPU so high?\n\nA specific, long-running query is consuming excessive resources every time it runs.\n\n3. Why is that query running so inefficiently?\n\nThe query is performing a full table scan because a critical database index is missing.\n\n4. Why is the necessary database index missing?\n\nThe index was dropped during a recent schema deployment script, and the performance impact wasn't caught.\n\n5. Why wasn't the performance impact caught before deployment to production?\n\nOur deployment process lacks a mandatory performance testing step against a production-like dataset in the staging environment.\n\nBy asking the five whys, we were no longer just fixing the immediate problem; we were fixing the system.\n\nIt’s a timeless tool because it’s fundamentally about curiosity and refusing to accept the surface-level answers.\n\n#ProblemManagement #RootCauseAnalysis #FiveWhys #ContinuousImprovement #ITSM #ProcessImprovement #ToyotaProductionSystem",

If you want to go far, go together.\" - African Proverb\n\nAnd go far we did. \n\nWith each run, the next one became easier. \n\nWe weren’t breaking records, but we were building something more important: resilience and our why. \n\nBy the time we stood at the start line today, I had no doubt we would pull it through.\n\nAnd so we did.\n\nThe track was crowded at times, and the forest was pitch black in sections, making it risky to see where to put our feet. \n\nBut side by side, we pressed on. \n\nWe crossed the finish line together in just around 30 minutes.\n\nIt’s always fun to do a new race, and this one was particularly well-arranged with lots of fun activities leading up to the race. \n\nBut today, the greatest fun came from sharing the moments and experiences with my son. \n\nThe post-finish euphoria was a feeling like no other.\n\n\"A father’s footsteps are the greatest legacy he can leave his children.\"\n\nAs we walked away, still buzzing from the achievement, we started already looking at which race to run together next.\n\nI’ve always hoped to pass on my passion and love for running to my kids. \n\nAnd what better way to do it than through putting it to the ultimate test in a race? \n\nIt’s more than just health and fitness; it’s about setting a goal, working for it together, and sharing the triumph.\n\nHere’s to the next starting line with my favorite running mate!\n\n#Fatherhood #Running #Passion #Family #Goals #5k #LifeLessons #Legacy",

We actively monitored API usage to help partners optimize and ran outside-in monitoring to catch risks before they became incidents.\n\nThis experience cemented my belief that in the connected economy, your API is your product. \n\nIt's the promise you make to your partners. \n\nIf it's fragile, inconsistent, or insecure, the entire business relationship crumbles.\n\nFor any B2B SaaS company, investing in a robust, standardized, and secure API infrastructure isn't a technical afterthought - it's the foundation of trust, scalability, and long-term partnership. \n\nIt’s the invisible engine that allows the entire ecosystem to thrive.\n\n#B2B #SaaS #API #DigitalTransformation #OperationalExcellence #Tech #Integration #Reliability",

        "text": "📣 Here’s my take on the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme. This is a bureaucratic policy proposal divided up by different directorates with civil servants working in complete silos in the Commission without political leadership actually wanting our companies to succeed! \n\nThere are a lot of new “Acts” with a lot of potential for overlap, like with the Innovation Act and the Advanced Materials Act? This needs to be fixed before new money flows in the next budget. \n\nThe continued apparent focus on simplification and defence preparedness is good if delivered in practice. Harmonisation we need for our markets. The pushes on Quantum and a refreshed Chips agenda can be steps in the right direction if done correctly. \n\n☝️ First, the 28th Regime. This could actually fix a real structural problem whereby EU firms can’t scale easily across borders. But it must be bold, concrete and deliver a truly EU-wide way to operate when it comes to the legal entity, registry, standardization for all companies and NOT propose a Directive that member states can then implement how they want - if they want. \n\n☝️ On digital. I am worried about the Digital Fairness Act. We should really put pressure on the Commission to withdraw the whole idea of pushing any new regulation on digital. The priority should be enforcing what we already have and cutting red tape. Any gaps can be fixed with proper enforcement. \n\n❗️ We should really now focus on enforcement and NOT push new regulation to the agenda. \nI’m expecting a lot from the digital omnibus. AVMSD should be a simplification exercise as well as a review of the GDPR. The unfortunate CSAM proposal the Commission should finally withdraw completely. ❗️\n\n👉 Our huge problem is that our digital regulation has been done in complete silos. We need a real cross-check on our digital laws, and a one stop shop for companies to understand what they need to comply with and cut, cut, cut unnecessary and overlapping regulation. \n\nAt the same time we need a real digital tax, contributing to the EU budget, applying to  third country companies entering and doing business in our market. \n\n💶 Finally, on capital markets and Merz’s recent call for a single European stock market. That’s the kind of ambition we need - finish CMU on insolvency law, taxation and open European pension funds for cross-border investments - rather than write more rules that fragment the Single Market. This could be better reflected in what the Commission hopes to achieve in an entire year. Draghi’s message on competitiveness might be heard but not understood. \n\nEU–INC \n#28regime\n#tech \n#digital\n#markets \n#capital",

        "text": "Like many, I was excited to dive into Sahil Bloom's much-praised book, The 5 Types of Wealth. \n\nHaving followed his work (mostly online), I expected a transformative read. \n\nThe book offers a crucial and valuable mindset shift, but I have to be honest: I found the audiobook experience somewhat monotonous. \n\nMuch of the content, while wise, felt like it would be more impactful as a series of concise Instagram infographics or a long-form article.\n\nThat said, let's talk about what makes the core idea so compelling.\n\nThe book's premise is a powerful antidote to our cultural obsession with financial wealth. \n\nBloom argues that we've been playing a game with a broken scoreboard, one that only measures money. \n\nTrue, lasting fulfillment comes from building and balancing five distinct types of wealth:\n\n1. Financial Wealth: The traditional measure - money and assets. Bloom stresses it's an enabler, not the end goal.\n\n2. Time Wealth: The freedom to control how you spend your time, which is our most finite resource.\n\n3. Social Wealth: The quality of your relationships and community, which is a key predictor of long-term happiness and health.\n\n4. Mental Wealth: A mindset of curiosity, purpose, and continuous growth.\n\n5. Physical Wealth: Your health and vitality, which is the foundation that allows you to enjoy all other forms of wealth.\n\nThe key insight is that these are not separate; they are interconnected. \n\nNeglecting one (like Social Wealth while chasing Financial Wealth) can make the entire structure unstable.\n\nA few concepts from the book have stuck with me:\n\n- The \"Pyrrhic Victory\" of Modern Success: You can win the battle (a promotion, a bonus) but lose the war (your health, relationships). This metaphor perfectly captures the danger of a single-minded focus.\n\n- \"You're Your Child's Favorite Person for 10 Years\": This quote from the book is a gut punch that forces you to reevaluate your priorities and time allocation.\n\n- The \"Life Razor\": Create a single, identity-defining statement to guide your decisions (e.g., \"I am the type of person who...\"). It's a simple tool to cut through complexity and stay aligned with your values. \n\n- Money Buys Happiness, Until It Doesn't: Bloom agrees money reduces burdens and buys happiness up to a point. Beyond that, the returns diminish dramatically, and the mindless chase for more becomes a trap.\n\nIt's worth noting that the book has been widely celebrated, which is why I picked it up in the first place. \n\nTim Cook, CEO of Apple, called it \"a powerful call to action to think deeply about what lights you up\".\n\nIs this book worth reading?\n\nYes, but with managed expectations.\n\nThe 5 Types of Wealth framework is genuinely insightful and impactful. It provides a practical and holistic lens through which to view your life and choices. \n\nFor anyone feeling stuck on the hedonic treadmill of \"more,\" this book can be a course correction.\n\n#BookReview #The5TypesOfWealth #SahilBloom #PersonalDevelopment #Wealth",

And today, we saw that speed in action.\n\nIt's also a powerful reminder for businesses: the cloud is resilient, but your architecture must be, too. \n\nDesigning for failure across multiple Availability Zones isn't a best practice; it's a business necessity.\n\n#AWS #CloudComputing #TechOutage #DigitalTransformation #Resilience",

        "text": "Sometimes I get the question:\n\n\"Why is security in the cloud better than on-premise?\"\n\nHere’s the thing. When done right, cloud security can be fundamentally stronger. \n\n(Key phrase: when done right. You can absolutely create a horrendous security setup in the cloud, often by treating it like a traditional data center.)\n\nSo, let's break down the \"why.\" \n\nHere are a few key differentiators that have convinced me:\n\n1. Microsegmentation & Zero Trust: \n\nThis isn't just a nice-to-have anymore; it's a necessity. In the cloud, implementing granular, identity-aware security policies is native. And when all your infrastructure is defined as code, spinning up a completely isolated environment for Cloud workloads is trivial.\n\n2. Visibility & Compliance: \n\nEver lose track of a server tucked away in a closet? In the cloud, that's much harder. Every resource is billable, which means the cloud providers have a built-in incentive to help you see everything. This creates incredible transparency, making asset management, patching, and ensuring compliance far more manageable.\n\n3. World-Class DDoS Protection, Out-of-the-Box: \n\nThe scale is just different. The major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) have global networks designed to absorb and mitigate the largest DDoS attacks imaginable - at a scale that would overwhelm traditional on-premise vendor appliances, and it's typically a core part of their service.\n\n4. The Power of Shared Fate: \n\nThis goes beyond the \"shared responsibility\" model. It's in the CSP's direct business interest that you are secure. If you're hacked, it can impact their platform's reputation and stability. Because of this, they invest heavily in proactive threat detection and will often swiftly deal with suspicious activities across all environments, notifying you and guiding you on next steps.\n\n5. IAM, But Less of a Hassle: \n\nLet's be honest, Identity and Access Management is complex everywhere. But in the cloud, the tools are built from the ground up to support principles of least privilege, just-in-time access, and role assessment. The guardrails and visibility are simply more mature and integrated.\n\nThe bottom line? The cloud provides a security model that is more automated, visible, and inherently resilient. \n\nIt’s not magic, but it is a powerful force multiplier for engineering and security teams.\n\nWhat would you add to the list? \n\n#CloudSecurity #ZeroTrust #Cybersecurity #DevSecOps #IAM #DDoS #SharedResponsibility",

        "text": "The European Commission just launched its Apply AI strategy. My initial thoughts: are you serious? ❓\n\nThe strategy is right in that Europe should lead in applying AI in key sectors like healthcare, energy, mobility, and manufacturing but it doesn’t offer any solutions. But wait, it does - new AI application for farmers? 💡 You have got to be kidding me. 🫣\n\nThe strategy also hints at reducing dependence and increasing the EU’s tech sovereignty. Also - great, we all agree, but where are concrete actions? \n\nTo be honest: ☝️ We don’t need more roadmaps, strategies or observatories. We know the problems and one of them is definitely the Commission itself. More coherence between the Commission’s different directorates would be a good start and strengthen its knowledge of business and technology. \n\nMore public money is not a solution. 👉 First, we don’t have the kind of money that would actually help to scale and secondly, the public sector’s job is to enable the market, not give money to businesses that don't get it from the private sector.\n\n❗️We are stuck with our maze of regulation that is fragmented and overlapping. This is where the Commission’s focus should be. Confusion won’t deliver sovereignty. And I don’t believe for a second that the proposed AI Act service desk in the Commission will help companies working on AI to understand how they should comply but it will for sure create extra work for everyone. ❗️\n\nIf we want to be truly competitive and have the most beneficial AI being made in Europe, deployed in Europe, and to be used by Europeans - it must be easier to scale here and easier to choose European. 🇪🇺\n\nI will repeat myself until the end of history by saying that we urgently need:\n\n📌 A REAL capital markets union with more cross-boarder risk funding and access to funding for scale ups.\n\n📌 Lead by example and use public procurement to prioritise European solutions.\nBe ambitious about deregulation! Reduce regulation in the upcoming digital omnibus and do not propose anything new.\n\n📌 Make the 28th regime, meaning  one business landing zone and a harmonised business register, reality in the EU. \n\nIn the name of European technological sovereignty. \n\n\n#AI\n#tech\n#data\n#sovereignty\n#europe\n#28regime",

        "text": "Listening to the \"#Acquired\" podcast on the history of #Alphabet brought back a flood of memories from 2008. It was just one year after the #iPhone launch, and the year #Android was announced. I was at #Nokia.\n\nWe were still the undisputed leader in mobile, but the cracks were beginning to show. Our frantic efforts to catch up to both Apple and Google were, quite honestly, falling short, but we were not giving up. \n\nIt was in this climate of rising panic that we tied our fortunes to Microsoft, a company that had, until then, been fairly unsuccessful in mobile.\n\nCome Android, with its strong backing from carriers and OEMs, and the marriage of Nokia and Microsoft became a fact. In retrospect, as Vic Gundotra famously stated, “Two turkeys don’t make an eagle.”\n\nNeither company was eager to change its ways too drastically in the face of eminent danger. \n\nMicrosoft still wanted to collect meagre licenses from OEMs, and Nokia still had tens of product lines with their respective quirks and perks. This made standardisation, focus, and faster time to market an impossibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Google offered carriers and OEMs a free operating system and a revenue share on search traffic. \n\nThe value proposition was undeniable. \n\nWhy would anyone other than Microsoft and Nokia be interested in preserving the status quo?\n\nFast forward to today: Android is in over 3 billion pockets, twice the number Nokia had at its peak in 2007. Microsoft has long since left the mobile space.\n\nIt all looks so clear in retrospect. \n\nBut at the time, I remember all my hard efforts, evangelising the Windows Phone ecosystem on Nokia #Lumia devices. It’s a fairly unknown story that many of the early Windows Phone apps in Scandinavia came to be thanks to the dedicated, against-the-odds efforts of me and my colleagues at Nokia and Microsoft.\n\nWe fought hard. \n\nIt was, however, not enough to reform two titans to successfully face the disruptive forces of Google and Apple. \n\nA sobering lesson in strategy, partnership, and the power of an open model.\n\n#Nokia #Microsoft #Google #Android #Apple #Mobile #TechHistory #Strategy #Leadership #LessonsLearned #WindowsPhone #Innovation",

        "text": "My first impression of “7 Rules of Power” by Jeffrey Pfeffer was that it was highly cynical. \n\nBut as I listened, its pragmatic advice grew on me.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer argues that power is a tool, and like any tool, its moral weight depends on the user. \n\nThe rules are brutally effective, even if the examples of figures like Trump, Musk, and Bezos aren't personally who I aspire to emulate.\n\nHere are the 7 Rules of Power:\n\n1. Get Out of Your Own Way. (Stop the self-sabotage).\n\n2. Break the Rules. (It's often easier to ask for forgiveness than permission).\n\n3. Appear Powerful. (Confidence is often taken as competence).\n\n4. Build a Powerful Brand. (Craft and control your narrative).\n\n5. Network Relentlessly. (Your network is your net worth).\n\n6. Use Your Power. (It depletes if not exercised).\n\n7. Success Excuses Almost Everything. (The most controversial, yet hard to deny).\n\nMy Takeaway: This isn't your regular feel-good leadership book. \n\nIt's a playbook for the real world. \n\nThe rules can feel uncomfortable, but they describe how organizational dynamics oftentimes work. \n\nAs Pfeffer says, \n\n\"Power is a tool. More good people need to be willing to use it.\"\n\nI recommend it not as a moral compass, but as a necessary dose of strategic reality. \n\nIt’s given me a lot to think about.\n\n#7RulesOfPower #JeffreyPfeffer #BookReview #Leadership #CareerDevelopment #PowerSkills #Strategy",

        "text": "Having been a great fan of Blade Runner for as long as I can remember, I knew I had to eventually read the book that served as its inspiration. \n\nPhilip K. Dick's ”Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” is the foundational text from which Ridley Scott and his team borrowed a significant amount of themes and plot elements.\n\nI finally read it, and the book stands perfectly well on its own. \n\nWhile not as action-packed as the film, it delivers profound suspense while engaging with quintessential questions: \n\nWhat defines a human versus an artificial being? \n\nWhat value lies in artificial life, be it androids or electric sheep? \n\nWhat kind of love, or at least feelings, can one have for artificial life?\n\nThough not overly dense, the book successfully engages the brain to ponder these essential subjects. In the age of AI, these questions are more relevant than ever.\n\nA central theme is the exploration of empathy as the defining characteristic of humanity. \n\nThe plot revolves around bounty hunters using an \"empathy test\" to distinguish humans from androids. \n\nHowever, as the story progresses, this clear distinction begins to blur.\n\n- The Empathy Paradox: The protagonist, Rick Deckard, is tasked with \"retiring\" androids based on their supposed lack of empathy. Yet, he finds himself developing empathetic feelings for them, while some humans display a shocking lack of it . This forces him to question the very framework he operates within.\n\n- The Blurred Line: Androids in the story are not merely cold machines. They exhibit behaviors that resemble love, grief, and a desire for self-preservation, making them feel less mechanical and more complex. As I reflected, it seems that with a few more generations, they could emulate empathy well enough to be indistinguishable from humans.\n\n- The Reality of Artificiality: The novel constantly interrogates the value of \"real\" experiences in a world dominated by simulations. People use \"mood organs\" to artificially generate their feelings , and ownership of real animals is a major status symbol precisely because most people can only afford perfect electric replicas . This creates a society where the authentic is desperately sought after, yet the artificial is seamlessly integrated into daily life.\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is an excellent, thought-provoking read and a must-have on any sci-fi shelf. \n\nIt provides a deep, philosophical foundation that complements the stylistic brilliance of Blade Runner. \n\nThe book challenges us to look beyond the surface and question what truly gives life - whether organic or synthetic - its value.\n\nIn today's world, where AI is advancing at a breathtaking pace, Dick's novel is not just a classic of the genre but a crucial mirror held up to our own technological and ethical landscape.\n\n#DoAndroidsDreamOfElectricSheep #BladeRunner #PhilipKDick #ScienceFiction #BookReview",

As this all wouldn't have been possible without the unwavering support of Christopher Åhl and his colleagues, whose dedication to ensuring an excellent meetup experience was evident throughout.\n\nWe had a deep dive into how SEB, a 170-year-old bank, scales and automates its massive cloud infrastructure, thanks to William Milisic and Gergely Szilágyi. Carl Sandström walked us through SEB's Rust adoption journey, the challenges, the breakthroughs and key lessons along the way. Then, Ankur Roy tied together code, cloud, and (yes) Swedish semla in the talk.\n\nAnd of course, to all the participants: thanks for your meticulous questions, engagement and energy!\n\nGDG Cloud Stockholm rocks. 🤘\n\nGDG Cloud Stockholm organizers: Zahra Mirzaei Marina Dushkina Mostafa Moradian\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gABZeKtc",

        "text": "The argument that \"if we just stick to Kubernetes and avoid serverless, we won't be locked in\" is a common but fundamentally naive oversimplification of cloud vendor lock-in. \n\nThis perspective conflates platform portability with application portability, ignoring the true source of flexibility: your team's talent and your code's architecture.\n\nTo be blunt, if you have engineers capable of writing, rewriting, and adapting your code for new hosting environments at will, you are never truly locked in. \n\nYour flexibility is a function of your human capital and architectural choices. \n\nIf you lack this engineering capability, then your strategic problems run far deeper than a simple Kubernetes vs. serverless debate; you are already vulnerable, regardless of your infrastructure choice.\n\nLet's dissect the serverless lock-in myth. \n\nWhen you build a serverless architecture on a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions), you are, in most cases, deploying your code to a container-based runtime. \n\nThe key is that the cloud provider manages this container, its scaling, and its networking entirely for you. \n\nCrucially, the underlying code itself - your business logic - is often not inherently locked to that platform. \n\nWith careful abstraction, you can containerize that same logic and run it on Kubernetes. \n\nThe inverse - extracting a complex, stateful application deeply intertwined with Kubernetes APIs and custom operators to run on a pure serverless platform - is often far more difficult.\n\nThis leads to the critical cost-benefit analysis. \n\nThe promise of K8s is standardization and portability, but it comes at a steep price: a massive management overhead for the control plane, nodes, networking, storage, and ingress controllers. \n\nYou are effectively building and maintaining your own \"cloud\" within a cloud. \n\nServerless, by contrast, offloads this immense operational burden to the vendor, allowing your team to focus on delivering features.\n\nThe financial equation is stark: running a containerized application on a managed Kubernetes service (like EKS or GKE) can easily be an order of magnitude (10x) more expensive than its serverless equivalent for comparable workloads, primarily due to the cost of reserving always-on compute resources versus paying for precise, millisecond-level execution.\n\nIf you have the luxury of having workloads that fit the serverless model (event-driven, stateless, scalable) without functional drawbacks, you should consider yourself lucky. \n\nChoosing to forgo the immense benefits of serverless in favor of a more expensive, complex, and labor-intensive Kubernetes setup solely to avoid a mitigated form of lock-in is an irrational trade-off. \n\nTrue architectural maturity is about making strategic bets that maximize business value, not pursuing a purist - and often illusory - ideal of portability at any cost. \n\nThe most valuable portability is in your code and your team's skills, not in your choice of infra.\n\n#k8s #faas",

        "text": "Like many, I’ve found this year to be an emotional rollercoaster, professionally and personally. \n\nThe constant barrage of conflicting narratives, twisted facts, and blatant misinformation can be intellectually draining and deeply concerning. \n\nIt was in this context that I picked up General Michael V. Hayden’s 2018 book, \"Assault on Intelligence: American National Security in an Age of Lies.\"\n\nWhile written during the first half of the first Trump term, reading it now feels less like revisiting history and more like reading an urgent, clarifying memo about the present moment. \n\nHayden, former director of both the CIA and NSA, is no partisan bomb-thrower. \n\nHe is a career intelligence professional who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents. \n\nHis central thesis is as straightforward as it is alarming: the very concept of objective, knowable truth is under sustained attack, and this erosion is the single greatest threat to security and democratic integrity of the Western world.\n\nThe book masterfully outlines how the modern intelligence community works - its processes, its ethos of speaking truth to power, and its inherent uncertainties. \n\nHayden then contrasts this world of evidenced-based analysis with what he terms the \"post-truth\" environment, where feelings often outweigh facts and where the authorities of institutions are deliberately undermined.\n\nMy takeaways:\n\n1. The Professional Value of Truth: \n\nHayden argues that truth isn't a political opinion; it's a professional necessity. \n\nIn our businesses, we rely on accurate data, rational market analysis, and reliable communication to make sound decisions. \n\nThis book is a powerful reminder of what happens when those foundations are intentionally weakened.\n\n2. Institutional Integrity Matters: \n\nThe assault Hayden describes isn't just on individuals, but on institutions themselves - the press, the courts, and the intelligence community. \n\nThis resonates deeply in the corporate world. \n\nOur companies rely on trust in their brand, their products, and their leadership. \n\nUndermining that trust has severe, long-term consequences.\n\nAssault on Intelligence is not a comfortable read, but it is a necessary one. \n\nIt is a compelling, expertly argued defense of reason and expertise from a man who has spent his life in the intelligence community. \n\nFor professionals navigating a world increasingly saturated with misinformation, Hayden’s book provides both a critical warning and a measured dose of long-term optimism.\n\nIt also reminded me that upholding a commitment to truth isn’t just a moral choice; it’s a professional imperative.\n\n#BookReview #NationalSecurity #Intelligence #MichaelHayden #Truth #PostTruth #Strategy #CriticalThinking",

        "text": "Vill du skicka bilder till någon på internet? Då måste du först godkänna att staten scannar bilden. I veckan läckte uppgifter som visar att regeringen tycker att det är en bra idé.\n\nI flera år har EU:s regeringar försökt enas om det som har kallats “Chat control”. Nu har Arbetsgruppen under EU:s ministerråd träffats igen för att försöka närma sig ett beslut om saken.\n\nDet handlar om ett förslag att göra det obligatoriskt för nätjättar, i jakt på övergreppsmaterial, att scanna igenom allt det användarna skickar på nätet. Även i privata chattkonversationer.\n\nHur det har kunnat passera under tystnad?\n\nFör att brottet är barnporr. Ingen politiker vill protestera mot en sådan lag. Ingen vill framstå som att de försvarar pedofiler, även om konsekvensen är att varje medborgare är skyldig tills motsatsen bevisas.\n\nSkapare av förslaget var svenska EU-kommissionären Ylva Johansson. Kritiker av förslaget – vilket varit ovanligt unisont i allt från människorättsexperter, journalister och cybersäkerhets akademiker – menar att det skapar ett unikt intrång i rätten till privata samtal. För enligt ursprungsförslaget ska ingenting få vara hemligt på internet. Den helsträckskryptering som nätjättarna genom åren lagt miljarder på att utveckla – så att de själva aldrig ska kunna läsa sina användares privata konversationer – skulle brytas.\n\nMen det är tekniskt omöjligt. Hela idén med en sådan kryptering är att bara mottagare och avsändare kan läsa vad som skickas. Så i det senaste förslaget tror sig EU:s regeringar hittat ett kryphål: Medborgare ska först tillfrågas om de tillåter att staten tar en titt på bilden de är på väg att skicka, innan den går iväg. Tackar de nej? Ja, de får de heller inte använda internet för att skicka bilden.\n\nDet låter dystopiskt?\n\nTja, Sveriges regering tycker det är en bra idé. Det vet jag eftersom jag läst den instruktion regeringen skickat till den svenska grupp som sköter förhandlingen. Instruktionen läcktes till mig i veckan och jag har nu kunnat verifiera dess äkthet.\n\nI instruktionen tydliggörs att förslaget handlar om att “spårning” ska kunna ske “innan överföringen av innehåll och kräva användarens medgivande”. Denna typ av “frivillighet” är ett nästan ännu större intrång än att försöka övervaka alla bilder, eftersom det ställer ett ultimatum: Övervakas eller sluta använda internet. Ändå skriver regeringen i instruktionen att Sverige ser “positivt på att krypterade tjänster återigen omfattas” och det nya förslaget hanterar cybersäkerhetsfrågorna på “ett godtagbart sätt”.\n\nMandatet till förhandlingen är preliminärt eftersom ett godkännande ytterst behöver förankras även i riksdagen. Men riksdagen har redan gett sitt godkännande till tidigare kompromissförslag som varit inträngande på liknande sätt. Då har det inte bara gällt bilder (vilket det senaste förslaget begränsar sig till), utan även text.\n\nOch stödet har varit brett, alla partier utom Centerpartiet och Sverigedemokraterna är positiva (läs mer i länken)",

        "text": "There are probably a few things in the world as fun as sharing one’s favourite movies, music, games etc with one’s offspring. \n\nI’ve been most lucky in getting my 12 year old son to embrace some of my loves for entertainment categories as diverse as Star Wars, James Bond, Simpsons and South Park. More recently we watched The Tron Legacy together.\n\nThis is truly one of the classics. The eternal fight between light and dark, acceptance and dominance, David and Goliath. \n\nIt also comes with many learnings and insights weaved together within all the digital action.\n\nBeyond the incredible visuals and soundtrack, the film sparked a fantastic conversation with my son about what happens when technology escapes human control, and what it means to be ”real” and ”alive”. \n\nIt’s a story about a son stepping into the vast digital universe his father created, not to simply inherit it, but to understand it, challenge it, and ultimately redefine it on his own terms.\n\nIt struck me how much this mirrors our roles as leaders and mentors, whether in parenting or in business. \n\nWe aren't just passing down a static \"manual\" of what we know. \n\nWe're providing a framework, a \"Grid\" if you will, and then empowering the next generation to innovate, question, and improve upon it. \n\nOur goal and challenge is to create environments where they can find their own voice and write their own code.\n\nThe real magic isn't just in them embracing our old loves; it's in the new dialogues and shared understandings that emerge from them.\n\n#Parenting #Leadership #Legacy #Mentorship #TronLegacy #CompanyCulture",

What if this seemingly irrational choice is actually a genius move I'm missing?\"\n\nBut the truth is, what appears to be a bad strategic choice normally is just that: a bad strategic choice.\n\nThe best way to deal with that anxiety-inducing sales pitch is to see it for what it is: a live case study. \n\nLearn from someone else’s expensive mistakes as they happen. \n\nIt’s normally a much cheaper way to gain strategic clarity.\n\nThe strongest strategy is built on your own first principles, not on the fear of being left behind.\n\n#Strategy #Leadership #BusinessStrategy #DecisionMaking #FOMO #Sales",

        "text": "A number of years ago I met with David JP Phillips while working at NetEnt. \n\nHe was working with our senior management and as an up and coming manager I got the chance to spend 15 mins with David to sharpen my presentation skills. \n\nRarely has a person that I interacted so shortly with, had such a lasting impact on me as he did all these years ago. \n\nHe asked me to present something and afterwards he analysed the presentation and gave me pointers on what to work with. \n\nI got out, prepared a bit and got back in. \n\nHis pointers helped immensely already there and my presentation was immediately much better. \n\nI keep his pointers in my head still today whenever I’m presenting something. \n\nTherefore it’s been an incredibly fun experience reading his book ”High on Life”. \n\nHere’s what it taught me about the six substances that are essential for living a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\nDavid’s core idea is that we can consciously influence our own neurochemistry to boost our performance, wellbeing, and happiness. \n\nThese six substances are natural, potent, and available to everyone.\n\n🎯 Dopamine: The Reward Chemical\n- Motivation, focus, and the feeling of pleasure after achieving a goal. It’s the driver of our reward-seeking behaviour.\n- Break large goals into small, manageable tasks and celebrate completing each one.\n\n😊 Serotonin: The Mood Stabilizer\n- Regulating mood, feelings of well-being, happiness, and self-confidence. It gives you a sense of pride and significance.\n- Practice gratitude - reflect on your past achievements. Getting sunlight and spending time in nature are also powerful triggers.\n\n❤️ Oxytocin: The Love & Trust Hormone\n- Social bonding, building trust, deepening relationships, and reducing stress. It’s the foundation for human connection.\n- Give someone a genuine compliment, hug a loved one, or practice acts of kindness.\n\n🏃‍♂️ Endorphins: The Pain-Killing Chemical\n- Stress relief, pain suppression, and generating feelings of euphoria (the \"runner's high\"). It’s the body’s natural mask for pain.\n- Laughter is the easiest way. So is vigorous exercise.\n\n💪 Testosterone: The Confidence Hormone\n- Building confidence, fostering a sense of strength and well-being, and increasing competitiveness (in both men and women).\n- Winning (even small wins), setting and achieving goals, and strength training.\n\n🧘‍♂️ Cortisol: The Stress Chemical\n- This is the stress and alert hormone. In small, short bursts it's crucial for survival, but chronic high levels are harmful.\n- The key is to reduce and control it through meditation, deep breathing, laughter, and getting enough sleep.\n\nThe powerful lesson is that we are not passive victims of our brain chemistry. We have the agency to actively design our days and interactions to generate the positive substances naturally and manage the negative ones, leading to a more engaged, motivated, and fulfilling life.\n\n#personaldevelopment #selfleadership #hormones #highonlife",

Stop Passing It On.\n\nNow listening to David JP Phillips \"High on Life\" and one realisation in particular hit me hard: \n\n>> Managers hold the throttle on team stress.\n\nDeliberately or unknowingly putting your team under constant pressure isn’t about \"high performance\" - it’s in fact a disservice to them AND you.  \n\nI’ve from time to time been on the receiving end. \n\nMy rule? Rarely carry a manager’s stress to my team. \n\nIf it leaks? Time-box it. Never normalize it.\n\nScience backs this up:\n\n1️⃣ Stress is contagious (Harvard Business Review). Cortisol spikes cascade through teams.  \n\n2️⃣ Chronic stress shrinks brain (Yale), killing focus & creativity.  \n\n3️⃣ Psychological safety != pressure (Google’s Project Aristotle). Fear stifles growth.  \n\nHow I fight the cycle:\n\n✅ Name it: Call out stress sources transparently.  \n\n✅ Buffer up: Absorb pressure from above; filter demands.  \n\n✅ Model recovery: Take breaks. Encourage time off. No martyrdom.  \n\nLeaders! Your stress management isn’t just self-care - it’s also team care!\n\n#Leadership #SelfLeadership #StressManagement #PsychologicalSafety #TeamHealth #HighOnLife",

Several still critical governments are only asking for small modifications (e.g. searching for “known content” only or excluding end-to-end encryption) which would still result in mass searches and leaks of our private communications. The position of the new German government has not yet been decided.\n\nThat is why we now need to get involved and raise our voices to our governments and raise awareness in the wider population.\n\n→ Previously supportive governments must be convinced to change their minds\n\n→ Critical governments need to be pushed to demand comprehensive changes, as proposed by the #EuropeanParliament, and not just minor changes to the proposal.\n\nIn the absence of such fundamental revision, the proposal should be rejected altogether!",

        "text": "Thank you for all your messages and let me assure that I hear and understand your worry regarding #ChatControl #CSAM Danish proposal. We must stop this. ❗️\n\n👉 The Danish EU Presidency is pushing a new, even more radical and unbelievable, version of the so called Chat Control #CSAM proposal. The vote is now scheduled for October 14. \n\nIf the Hungarian proposal was bad, the Danish version is even more extreme pushing for a creation of an Orwellian world.\n\n 👉 It includes the mandatory mass scanning of private communications and aims to break secure encryption by forcing client-side scanning into the private messaging apps. ‼️\n\n☝️ The proposal as it stands now would force companies to scan for, not only known but also, \"unknown\" material using experimental and unreliable AI.\n\n☝️ The government and military accounts will be exempt from this intrusive and unreliable scanning. Sounds like an authoritarian leader's dream. 😣\n\nThis poses a massive risk of exposing our private communications and photos. Also non-transparent AI would make decisions about leaking your personal conversations and private photos.\n\nThis plan violates blatantly our fundamental rights due to accessing the content of private citizens. This will also create better access to criminals to our messaging services and achieve nothing to protect our children - the opposite.❗️\n\n👉 The next critical meeting is on September 12. Governments will be finalizing their positions by then. We must now ensure all countries and our citizens understand what this proposal stands for. ☝️ This would violate our privacy and not protect any children. \n\nThe European Parliament must also stand against mass scanning and breaking encryption. ❗️\n\n#privacy\n#CSA",

        "text": "Finished Greg McKeown’s sequel to “Essentialism”.\n\nHis book “Effortless\" sets out to prove that sustainable success isn’t about pushing harder - it’s about working smarter.\n\nHere are its key points:  \n\n1. Pair Essential with Enjoyable\n\n“The effortless state is incompatible with resentment. Make the essential things easy by making them enjoyable.” \n\n→ Mix essential tasks with joy. Brainstorm on walks. Listen to podcasts while doing admin. Listen to your favourite music while housecleaning. Combine whatever makes it lighter and easier to finish up your “chores”.\n\n2. Start with \"Minimum Viable Action\"\n\n“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” - Lao Tzu\n\n→ Ask: “What’s the tiniest step I can take right now?” Open the doc. Draft one sentence. Progress ≠ perfection.\n\n3. Timebox to Prevent Overcomplication\n\n\"Complexity is procrastination in disguise.\"\n\n→ Set boundaries for any effort. Set a lower and an upper time limit for any task big or small. Constraints create clarity and conserve energy.\n\n4. Build \"Done for Tomorrow\" Systems\n\n\"Do it once to benefit forever.”\n\n→ Automate, create templates, systematize. Document processes. Batch similar tasks. Invest minutes today to save hours tomorrow.\n\nIn the modern workplace, “Effortless” is your toolkit for impact without exhaustion. \n\nLess friction = more flow.  \n\n→ My takeaways:\n\n- Deliberately timeboxing work \n- Starting tasks I’d rather avoid with micro-actions \n\n#Effortless #Productivity #TimeManagement #Focus #GregMcKeown #WorkSmart #Timeboxing #SelfLeadership",

No certifications prepped.  \n\nInstead, I:\n\n🏞️ Hung out in the countryside without doing too much handyman work.\n\n👟 Took long solo runs & short ones with my son and daughter.\n\n🌊 Swam in the lake whenever I felt like it (or when the shade got too warm).\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Socialised more than usual with family and friends.\n\n🍖 Barbecued… a lot, plus made some pizza and improved those skills.\n\n🎢 And as weather cooled, embraced nearby adventures - like go-karting!  \n\nTruth be told? \n\nPart of me stressed over the “lost” time. \n\nBut a stronger part knew this unstructured rest was exactly what I needed.  \n\nNow, I’m returning not with checked boxes, but with renewed energy, clarity, and readiness for whatever challenges and opportunities this post-summer season brings. \n\nSometimes the most productive thing you can do… is simply recharge.\n\nHere’s to honoring rest as fuel! ⛽️ \n\n#WorkLifeBalance #RechargeAfterBreak #SummerVibes #ProductiveRest #Mindfulness #CareerGrowth",

No guilt, no FOMO. Just quiet appreciation for the pause.  \n\nWas it age? Hard-bought experience? \n\nProbably both. And honestly? It felt like growth.\n\nI still rode every slide (yes, even the \"oh-god-why\" ones, once!). \n\nBut watching my kids fly ahead while I caught my breath, I realized: \n\nKnowing your limits isn’t weakness; it’s clarity.\n\nI was proud to keep pace most of the time - and even prouder watching seniors tackle those same slides with grit and grins.  \n\nAs Teddy Roosevelt once said: \n\n\"Comparison is the thief of joy.\"\n\nYesterday wasn’t about keeping up. \n\nIt was about showing up - for the laughs, the shared moments, and the humility to step back when needed. And that, to me, is the real adventure.  \n\nTakeaway:\n\nEnergy fades. \n\nCourage evolves. \n\nBut curiosity? That’s ageless. \n\nHere’s to embracing the ride - on your terms!\n\n#Parenting #LifeLong #Adventure #GrowthMindset",

        "text": "Yesterday, I revisited a place I hadn't seen in at least 25 years: Storvadsbadet.\n\nA small beach less than a kilometre from Old Uppsala's royal mounds and historic church, nestled on the semi-natural shore of the Fyrisån river.\n\nThis quite unassuming spot was my summer sanctuary throughout my teens. \n\nWithout the means for vacations abroad, this was my Saint Tropez, my Playa del Inglés – just a 20-minute bike ride away.\n\nHere, I truly learned to swim in the river's dark waters. Here, my father dazzled with dives my sister and I desperately tried to copy.\n\nReturning yesterday, with my wife, kids, and parents beside me, unlocked a flood of positive memories. \n\nThe place felt timeless: the parking lot, the grass-covered slopes, the red sand, and the Fyrisån's familiar murkiness – all unchanged. \n\nWe arrived early, finding space before the sun drew crowds. Swimming with my son, I was instantly transported.\n\nAs if by magic, my 45 years dissolved. I was 14 again.\n\nSwimming upstream, then down, just as I used to. Memories surged back: a childhood woven with equal parts difficulties, opportunities, love, sadness, and topped off with hard work, and fierce determination to forge ahead.\n\nThat swim wasn't just exercise; it was a conversation with my younger self. And the most profound moment? \n\nSeeing my son catch up, then racing him back to shore. \n\nPride washed over me – not just in him, but in the enduring legacy of simple places and shared experiences.\n\n“We do not remember days, we remember moments.” – Cesare Pavese\n\nThe Takeaway:\n\nReconnecting with our roots, especially the humble ones that shaped us, is powerful. It reminds us where resilience, joy, and core values were forged. \n\nSharing those places with the next generation? \n\nThat’s where the past truly comes alive – and where we see how far we’ve swum. 🏊‍♂️\n\n#Nostalgia #Family #Resilience #PersonalGrowth #Swimming #Uppsala #Memories #Roots #Legacy\n\nP.S. 1st image: me and my sister back in the 90s in the Storvadsbadet parking lot, 2nd image: me and my son yesterday in roughly the same spot, 3rd image: an image of Storvadsbadet from yesterday.",

        "text": "It’s funny how people who don’t know you sometimes will assume your life has been linear and predetermined. \n\nMany see my fitness routine today and imagine I’ve always been a runner and gym enthusiast. \n\nWhen I reveal this habit is barely a decade old - starting in 2011 - they’re often startled.  \n\nBack then, my late twenties looked very different: endless work trips, constant snacks, zero exercise, and a pack-a-day smoking habit. Air miles piled up; my health did not.  \n\nThen came the catalyst: marriage and children. \n\nI asked myself: What kind of father did I want to be? One struggling to keep up? Or one matching my kids’ energy? I chose the latter.  \n\nBut resolve didn’t make it easy. \n\nStarting was brutal. \n\nI was the awkward newcomer in the gym, fumbling while everyone else seemed “born there.” I felt out of place, but I persisted.  \n\n\"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\" -  Aristotle\n\nAnd slowly, the habits stuck. I began with 2-3 days a week, honoring the routine. The more I ran and trained, the easier it became. \n\nResults compounded. As progress showed - a faster mile, heavier weights, more energy - my motivation snowballed.  \n\nToday? I run nearly daily and hit the gym 2-3 times weekly. \n\nI’m now the guy who looks like he was “born there” to the new person fiddling with equipment. And yes - I still (mostly!) outpace my teenagers 😉.  \n\nWhy share this?  \n\nBecause transformation is possible for anyone. \n\nI went from sedentary smoker to dedicated athlete in my 30s. \n\nNot through genetics or luck, but consistency and willpower.  \n\n\"Small habits don’t add up.

        "text": "\"Your calendar is full again? No worries, you can do the actual work tonight.\"  \n\nSound familiar? This mantra of modern work culture isn’t a badge of honor - it’s a recipe for burnout and stagnation. 🚨\n\nWorking now in the middle of Swedish ”industrial vacation”, makes me reflect how packed my calendar normally is and why the current pace and room for reflection can’t be normal modus operandi? \n\nThe Paradox:\nSome stress about having \"air\" in our calendars, yet glorify back-to-back meetings. \n\nSome call days \"for collaboration\" and nights \"for execution.\" \n\nBut if every minute is spoken for - whether you’re a CEO or a developer - when does the actual thinking happen?\n\nLet’s break this down with science:\n\n1️⃣  Reflection & Deep Work:\n”When do you get time to reflect on the work you’re assigned?\"\n\nCognitive science shows that reflection consolidates learning and improves decision-making (Harvard Business Review). \n\nConstant context-switching between meetings shatters focus, leaving no space for synthesis. \n\nCal Newport’s research on \"Deep Work\" proves that uninterrupted blocks are non-negotiable for high-value output.  \n\n2️⃣  Improvement & Efficiency:\n\"When do you identify improvements to make work better?\"\n\nContinuous improvement requires deliberate pause. \n\nAs Peter Drucker said, \"Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.\"\n\nWithout white space, we default to autopilot - repeating inefficiencies simply because there’s no time to question them.  \n\n3️⃣  Creativity & Innovation:\n”When do you make mind-leaps for breakthrough solutions?\"\n\nInsight doesn’t strike in a Teams call. \n\nNeuroscience reveals that ”aha!\" moments often arise during downtime (Default Mode Network research). \n\nArchimedes had his bathtub; you need calendar margins. Forcing \"out-of-the-box\" thinking in a boxed-in schedule is futile.  \n\nThe Hard Truth:\nA packed calendar isn’t productivity - it’s performative busyness. \n\nMeetings are tools, not the work itself.\n\nIf your role requires strategy, creation, or problem-solving (hint: most do), empty space isn’t luxury; it’s infrastructure.  \n\nThe Fix?\n🔹 Ruthlessly defend focus blocks (even 60 mins!).  \n🔹 Normalize declining meeting with unclear agendas & outcomes.  \n🔹 Measure output, not occupancy.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nAs Jason Fried (Basecamp) puts it: ”Work doesn’t happen at work. Meetings, interruptions, and distractions do.”\n\nIf we want better solutions, happier teams, and sustainable performance - we must reclaim the space to think.  \n\nYour move: How will you carve out \"air time\" this week?  \n\n#Productivity #DeepWork #TimeManagement #Leadership #Innovation #WorkCulture #MentalHealth #Focus",

        "text": "Recently returned from an amazing week in Mallorca – Spain never disappoints, and we’ll be back soon! ☀️ \n\nBut one experience at Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI) - operated by Aena, left us stressed and frustrated, highlighting a clear opportunity for improvement.  \n\nThe Issue:\n\nOn departure day, we arrived early, only to find no automated check-in or baggage drop counters. \n\nAll passengers were funneled into manual check-in lines. \n\nDespite 5 counters eventually opening, inefficiencies compounded:  \n\n- Staff handled complex items (e.g., a sword!) by involving multiple counters, halting the entire queue.  \n\n- Basic check-in (confirming passengers, printing boarding passes and luggage tags) took >5 minutes per group – a task that takes <5 min on automated counters such as those at Arlanda. \n\n- After a 1+ hour queue, and then security (thankfully smooth) left us sprinting to the gate during final boarding.  \n\nThe Cost:\n\nThis inefficiency didn’t just stress passengers – it cost the airport revenue.\n\nWe had zero time to shop, dine, or relax. \n\nMultiply that by hundreds of passengers daily, and the lost opportunity is significant.  \n\nThe Solution?\n\n- Automate routine tasks:\nSelf-service kiosks + baggage drops for standard check-ins free up staff.  \n\n- Dedicated counters:\nHandle special items/complex cases separately without disrupting flow.  \n\n- Training:\nEmpower staff to resolve issues swiftly without gridlocking operations.  \n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nEfficiency isn’t just about convenience – it’s economic. \n\nWhen airports streamline processes:  \n\n✅ Passengers spend more on retail/food.  \n\n✅ Stress drops, improving brand loyalty.  \n\n✅ Airlines face fewer delays.  \n\nInvesting in modern systems and automation pays for itself. \n\nPalma, we love you – but let’s make the farewell as warm as the welcome! ✈️  \n\n#TravelTech #Automation #AirportExperience #CustomerExperience #Aviation #Innovation #Mallorca #Travel",

        "text": "Yesterday, Oasis kicked off their highly anticipated reunion tour, and the news space overflowed with Gallagher brother drama. But one take truly surprised me.  \n\nDuring a Swedish radio segment, rather than diving straight into whether Liam and Noel would survive the tour without parting ways for another 16 years, the hosts started by explaining who Oasis even were - and what they meant for Britpop and modern music.  \n\nI’ll admit: it left me startled and shaken. \n\nIn my mind, their legacy felt like common knowledge - the anthems that defined a generation, the swagger that redefined rock. \n\nBut 16 years out of the spotlight? \n\nApparently, even giants fade from view.  \n\nAs the tour begins, I’m left reflecting on how quickly cultural memory shifts. \n\nWe once shouted ”Tonight, I’m a rock ‘n’ roll star!” at bars; now, a new audience hears ”Supersonic” live for the first time.  \n\nTo the Gallaghers: I hope you keep it together. Not just for the nostalgia, but because your music deserves new ears. \n\nThe world needs anthems that make crowds sway like ”Champagne Supernova,” lyrics that capture restless ambition like “I need some time in the sunshine.” 🌅  \n\nHere’s to hoping they don’t look back in anger - and that this reunion proves some things do live forever. 🎶  \n\n#Oasis #Britpop #ComebackTour #Nostalgia #Gallaghers #RockMusic\n\nP.S.

        "text": "I’m a longtime Jim Collins fan (”Good to Great” and ”Built to Last” are true classics!). \n\nAnother of his classics, now updated, ”Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0” delivers the deep research, actionable frameworks, and inspirational tone one would expect. \n\nThat said, much of the core material felt like a refinement of his established principles rather than groundbreaking new territory. \n\nIf you’re deeply familiar with his work, some sections will feel repetitive.  \n\nHowever, the power of Collins lies in timeless truths, not novelty.\n\nHere are my key takeaways:  \n\n1. Level 5 Leadership is Non-Negotiable:\nThe pinnacle of leadership combines fierce resolve with profound humility. \n\nLevel 5 leaders build greatness through others, not for themselves.  \n\n”Level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company.\"\n\n2. The \"BHAG\" (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) is Your North Star:\nA clear, daring, long-term goal galvanizes the entire organization beyond incrementalism. It’s not just strategy; it’s a unifying cause.\n\n\"A BHAG is clear and compelling, serves as a unifying focal point of effort, and acts as a clear catalyst for team spirit.”\n\n3. Culture > Strategy (The \"Smell of the Place\"):\nYour culture isn't posters on a wall; it’s the lived behaviors and values reinforced daily. Great cultures attract and retain exceptional people who thrive.  \n\n”Culture is not just about having fun. It’s about disciplined people engaging in disciplined thought and taking disciplined action.\"\n\n4. The Genius of the \"AND\":\nReject false trade-offs. Truly great companies pursue seemingly contradictory goals simultaneously (e.g., stability AND innovation, purpose AND profit, freedom AND responsibility). \n\n\"Embrace both extremes... not as forces to balance, but as forces to harness.\"\n\n5. Clock Building, Not Time Telling:\nFocus relentlessly on building a system (the \"clock\") that generates great results long after any single leader or hit product is gone. Build for endurance.  \n\n\"Build an organization that can endure and adapt, rather than just riding on a single great idea or charismatic leader.\"\n\n6. The 20 Mile March:\nConsistent, disciplined progress - achieving ambitious but predictable goals year after year - builds resilience and outperforms erratic bursts of effort.  \n\n\"Sustainable performance requires consistency through good times and bad.\"  \n\nWhile Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0 might not surprise Collins veterans, it remains an exceptionally valuable blueprint for leaders at any stage. \n\nIts strength lies in distilling decades of research into practical principles for building visionary, values-driven, and resilient companies. \n\nIf you're new to Collins, this is a phenomenal starting point. \n\nIf you're a seasoned reader, it’s a powerful refresher and refinement of enduring truths.  \n\n#JimCollins #BeyondEntrepreneurship #Leadership #CompanyCulture #BusinessStrategy #BookReview #BHAG",

Hohpe cuts through the noise with laser focus. \n\nThis book is an eye-opener, firmly grounded in first principles and centered on asking the crucial questions rather than blindly prescribing this or that framework. \n\nThe author expertly peels back the layers underneath the buzzwords and hype cycles that so often derail cloud initiatives. \n\nHe reminds us that successful cloud adoption is fundamentally a strategic, organisational, and leadership challenge – far more than just some technical problems to be solved. \n\nIf you feel your cloud strategy or migration is drifting, hitting roadblocks, or lacking clear direction, investing in a few copies of this book and starting a book circle might be the wisest course of action.\n\nAfter reading Hohpe's clear, principled, and decision-focused guidance, you'll know better how to cut through the confusion and concentrate on the key priorities and choices that lead to real success. \n\nAfter all, it’s not just about going to the cloud; it’s about succeeding once you're there by making the right decisions along the way.\n\n#CloudStrategy #CloudMigration #DigitalTransformation #Leadership #ITStrategy #BookReview #GregorHohpe #TechLeadership #DecisionMaking #CloudComputing",

        "text": "Had a fantastic session last week with our Summer Tech trainees at SEB! 🌟 \n\nI walked them through our cloud journey and explained how we empower developers with managed public cloud environments. \n\nOne brilliant question stood out:  \n\n\"How are cloud service providers fundamentally different from what regular companies can build internally?\"\n\nI shared my perspective then, but later discovered an even sharper answer in Gregor Hohpe’s ”Cloud Strategy”. \n\nHere’s the essence:  \n\nWhy On-Premises ≠ Cloud: 5 Key Differences\n\n1️⃣ Scale: Hyperscalers (like Google/AWS/Azure) operate 100–1000x larger data centers than most collocation facilities and definitely far larger than own data centers. On-prem can’t match their elastic capacity for burst workloads.  \n\n2️⃣ Hardware: Clouds use custom-designed infrastructure; on-prem relies on off-the-shelf gear.\n\n3️⃣ Diversity: Corporate data centers are often \"kitchen sinks\" of legacy tech; clouds are homogeneous and standardized.  \n\n4️⃣ Bandwidth: Hyperscalers sit on internet backbones and lay thousands of kilometres of subsea fibre-optic cables; on-prem battles latency (20–30ms hops).  \n\n5️⃣ Global Reach: Clouds deliver low-latency access worldwide; on-prem is typically region-locked.\n\nTo these five differences, one could add rate of innovation at CSPs due to both scale of operations (billions of users) and scale of both employed and associated talent (in hundreds of thousands and millions individuals), deep integration between various layers in the CSP service offering etc. \n\n⚠️ The Big Takeaway:\n\nIt’s easy to be fooled by surface similarities. \n\nHowever, on-prem and cloud operate in radically different contexts. \n\nAbstraction layers that ignore this often become costly illusions. \n\nMassive thanks to our curious trainees for sparking this reflection! 🙌 \n\nAttaching a screengrab from Gregor Hohpe’s brilliant book for detail.  \n\n#CloudComputing #OnPremise #HybridCloud #SEB #TechLeadership #DigitalTransformation #CloudStrategy",

        "text": "We’ve all heard the dream: \n\n”Go cloud-agnostic! Portability! Freedom! Avoid vendor lock-in!”\n\nBut after years in the trenches, I’ve seen this sales pitch crumble under real-world complexity. \n\nHere’s why the “agnostic” promise often backfires - and how to do multicloud right:\n\n❌ The Myth of Magic Portability  \n\nVendor tools promising seamless cloud portability sound great - until you realize:  \n\n- They play favorites (not all clouds are supported equally).  \n\n- Feature parity is rare (you’ll miss out on CSP-native innovations).  \n\n- You’re stuck with the lowest common denominator of features across clouds.  \n\n🚫 The Illusion of Team Autonomy  \n\n“Let every team pick their cloud!” sounds flexible - until you face:  \n\n- Policy/security/compliance hell: Reinventing governance per cloud.  \n\n- Wasted effort: Years spent maturing one cloud environment don’t magically make the effort much smaller when adding 2–3 more.  \n\n- Fragmented skills: Platform engineers now juggle 3–4 cloud systems (+ on-prem!), diluting mastery.  \n\n✅ The Pragmatic Path: Strategic Multicloud  \n\nMulticloud can work - if you’re disciplined:  \n\n1. Choose clouds for their strengths and only place workloads that make both technical and business sense in each.\n\n2. Govern fiercely: No rogue team choices. Standardize where it matters (IAM, networking, compliance).  \n\n3. Invest in deep expertise: You can’t leverage a cloud’s full potential without understanding its DNA.  \n\n4. Accept reality: Some duplication is inevitable - optimize for outcomes, not theoretical portability.  \n\n🎯 The Bottom Line  \n\n“Cloud agnostic” often means “cloud mediocre.”\n\nTrue multicloud success isn’t about forcing sameness - it’s about intentionally leveraging difference. \n\nMaster each cloud’s depth, align with business goals, and govern with rigor. \n\nOnly then do you reap real benefits.  \n\n#CloudStrategy #Multicloud #CloudComputing #TechLeadership #DigitalTransformation #CloudTransformation",

Essentialism conserves mental energy for critical decisions.  \n\n- The Paradox of Choice (Schwartz, 2004): More options increase anxiety and reduce satisfaction. Essentialism reduces clutter - mental and physical.  \n\n- Opportunity Cost (Economics 101): Saying \"yes\" to one thing always means saying \"no\" to another. Essentialism forces honest trade-off evaluations.  \n\nIt’s important to remember that non-essential tasks aren’t harmless - they actively steal resources from game-changing work.\n\nAs McKeown writes: \"The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default.\"\n\nIf you’re overwhelmed, feel busy but unfulfilled, or struggle with boundaries, this book offers actionable clarity. \n\nIt’s not about doing less arbitrarily - it’s about making \"yes\" monumental by mastering \"no.\"\n\nEssentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. \n\n#Essentialism #Productivity #Focus #WorkLifeBalance #Leadership #BookReview",

        "text": "I had a great time yesterday presenting at the #googlecloudsummitnordics together with Gergely Szilágyi about our cloud journey at SEB, and how we are supporting thousands of developers with thousands of #GCP projects, through some automation magic and some amazing DevOps chops. \n\nTruth to be told, I don't enjoy the spotlight as much as one could think, but I am not afraid either when it's a topic I care about.\n\nFunny enough, although I spend some thoughts on what to say, when I stand there on stage, at least half of it remains unsaid. \n\nJust for fun, here is what I was thinking of saying on my 2 slides. \n\nSlide 1: \n\n\"The slogan for our tech organisation ”Head in the cloud, feet on the ground” is telling for both where we are heading, where we are as well as how we reason about technology. \n\nWe employ 3000 engineers working in all possible tech stacks, from Cobol on mainframe to Golang on Knative. \n\nTechnology has been a natural part of our DNA since start almost 170 years ago and cloud transformation is no different. \n\nSEB’s cloud journey started back in 2019 with some initial exploration but got really serious when we signed our agreement with Google in 2021. \n\nIt hasn’t always been a straight road, there have been bumps on the way, but we have kept the course steady forward. \n\nOur initial setup was heavily oriented towards the full stack developers, or if you want early adopters in Geoffrey Moore's technology adoption curve. \n\nWe made sure there were guardrails, controls etc while still leaving development teams to fully manage, develop and operate their piece of our cloud. \n\nOver time however as more and more teams came into cloud we realized that full stack developers that want to code Java in the morning, have JavaScript for lunch and plan Terraform for dinner, are as rare as unicorns, so we began adding more and more platform engineering layers to fully support all our development teams needs. \n\nWe’ve been on this journey for a few years now and our adoption numbers among our developer community are telling the story better than anything, while we also see that our engagement numbers have been consistently increasing over time.\"\n\nFor slide 2 notes, see Comments. \n\nFor how the talk actually turned out, watch the on-demand video available on Google Cloud Summit Nordics page. Video in comments. Registration required.\n\nI want to extend a thank you to Google Cloud for showcasing our story, to the audience that seemed interested and engaged throughout and to my partner on stage Gergely Szilágyi for great discussions and many laughs while preparing our presentation!\n\n#SEBTech #SEBCloud #LifeatSEB",

        "text": "Just wrapped up another excellent Google Cloud Summit Nordics! Here are my top \"aha\" moments:\n\n1️⃣  Lift & Shift is Still Lift & Shi*t\n\nThe message was clear: ask any successful cloud migration what strategy they started with, and they'll confirm that going cloud makes sense only if you plan to use the cloud as intended – cloud-native. Trying to replicate on-premise setups directly is still missing the point. See excellent presentations by Terveystalo and Mouseflow.\n\n2️⃣  Digital Sovereignty: Pieces Falling In Place, But Gaps Remain\n    \nAll major cloud providers are talking data boundaries, local partnerships, and even bringing some key cloud capabilities back on-premise. While many building blocks are there, key pieces are still missing. Significant progress beyond the current level will likely require additional EU laws and regulations. The intent is visible, but the full solution isn't quite baked yet.\n\n3️⃣  AI: Impressive, Contextual... But Where's the Groundbreaking?\n\nThe agentic and AI use cases showcased were undeniably impressive, especially regarding contextual reasoning and \"intelligence.\" However, I'm yet to see that truly revolutionary, jaw-dropping use case. Maybe that's just where we are right now? Or perhaps AI has become so seamlessly integrated and \"at home\" that our expectations have skyrocketed, making it harder to be as impressed as we were a few years ago. Solid progress, but the true paradigm shift feels... pending.\n\nOverall: A really well-organized event (as usual from Google Cloud!). \n\nMaybe the best part? Catching up with old colleagues I hadn't seen in years – priceless. \n\nBig thanks to Google for hosting these invaluable gatherings!\n\nP.S. Stay tuned tomorrow for some thoughts on the lightning talk presentation I held together with Gergely Szilágyi.\n\n#GoogleCloud #CloudSummit #Nordics #CloudMigration #CloudNative #DigitalSovereignty #AI #GenerativeAI #TechEvent #SEBcloud #SEBtech #lifeatSEB",

Period.  \n\nWhy isn’t it?\n\n1️⃣ Cost Avoidance: Airgapping, EU-based governance, and legal firewalls reduce vendor control and profitability. \n\n2️⃣ Jurisdictional Evasion: Default sovereignty limits extraterritorial reach of U.S. laws – a red line for Washington.  \n\n3️⃣ Compliance Theater: \"Specialized\" sovereign offerings let providers simulate compliance without overhauling core infrastructure.  \n\nI think it’s no more than reasonable to demand: \n\n- No more \"sovereign-as-a-side-project.\"  \n\n- Every European region: airgapped, EU-governed, legally shielded.\n\nSovereignty isn’t a \"feature.\" \n\nIt’s the foundation.  \n\n#SovereignCloud #DigitalSovereignty #DataPrivacy #EUTech #CloudProviders",

This is where we normally live. \n\nBut the magic? That's Kairos (καιρός):  \n\n⏳ The opportune moment.\n\n🚪 The open door, the gut-feeling \"YES,\" the perfect pivot.  \n\n💡 Inspiration striking, deep connection, flow state unlocked.  \n\nQualitative, ripe, divine timing. We yearn for this.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS: \n\n🔹 Kronos overload burns us out (always \"on,\" never \"done\").  \n\n🔹 Kairos blindness makes us miss gold (distracted, head down).  \n\nHACK YOUR TIME:\n\n1. Protect Kronos ruthlessly: Batch tasks, mute notifications, say \"no.\" ⏱️🔒  \n\n2. Create space for Kairos: Wander, wonder, disconnect. Be present. 🌱✨  \n\n3. Recognize the Kairos whisper: That urge to call someone you just thought of? Start with a new habit? DO IT. 🚀  \n\nKronos runs the clock. \n\nBut Kairos changes the game.\n\nStop just managing time.  \n\nStart seizing moments.  \n\nAmong my most memorable Kairos moments were the births of my two children. When I afterwards was holding them in my arms, time stood still. \n\nWhat are your most memorable Kairos moments?\n\n#TimeManagement #Mindfulness #Productivity #Leadership #PersonalDevelopment #Kairos #Kronos #DeepWork #Innovation #WorkLifeBalance",

A real cloud requires:  \n\n✅ On-demand self-service (not approval queues) \n\n✅ Rapid elasticity (not “wait 6 weeks for capacity”)  \n\n✅ Resource pooling (not siloed infrastructure)  \n\n✅ Measured service (not opaque cost allocation)  \n\n✅ Broad network access (not VPN tunnels)  \n\nYet, enterprises keep slapping “cloud” on legacy systems with clunky onboarding, private-only deployments, and minimal scalability. \n\nThe result? A cloud-washed relic that delivers none of the agility or innovation the cloud promises.  \n\nWhat now?\n\n👉 Audit your stack against NIST’s 5 pillars.  \n\n👉 Kill bottlenecks that mimic on-prem workflows.  \n\n👉 If it’s not elastic, self-service, or metered - it’s not a cloud.  \n\nDon’t let your “cloud” be the emperor’s new data center. 🏰⚡  \n\n#CloudComputing #NIST #DigitalTransformation #EnterpriseIT #CloudWashing",

        "text": "From IaC to Machine-Building Machines: The Next Evolution in Cloud Engineering\n\nWhen we talk about Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the benefits are undeniable: versioned setups, minimized drift, and full control over cloud environments. \n\nBut here’s the catch - scaling IaC to thousands of cloud environments is where the real challenge begins.  \n\nManaging consistency, enforcing standards, and preventing sprawl across a sea of environments isn’t just about writing Terraform modules or CloudFormation templates anymore. \n\nIt demands something far more systemic: a Landing Zone Vending Machine.\n\n🤖 What is then a Landing Zone Vending Machine?  \n\nImagine a system that:  \n\n1. Orchestrates all cloud environments toward a baseline configuration (your \"landing zone\").  \n\n2. Generates IaC code on-demand for creation, updates, and maintenance.  \n\n3. Validates inputs, handles errors gracefully, and ensures compliance before deployment.  \n\nIn short, it’s a machine that builds machines.\n\nThis isn’t just infrastructure automation - it’s software development applied to infrastructure itself. \n\n👉 Why This Changes Everything for Cloud Engineers\n  \nTraditional IaC requires scripting skills. \n\nBuilding a vending machine demands software engineering rigor: \n\n- Designing systems to process user input → generate code → deploy infrastructure.  \n\n- Implementing validation, error handling, and state management at scale.  \n\n- Treating the vending machine itself as a product, with CI/CD, testing, and observability.  \n\nThis shift mirrors trends like Platform Engineering and Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), where infrastructure becomes a self-service, codified product.  \n\n🔍 Real-World Parallels  \n\n- AWS Control Tower and Azure Landing Zones are managed solutions for multi-account governance - but custom vending machines take this further, tailoring IaC generation to org-specific needs.  \n\n- Companies like Spotify and Netflix pioneered similar concepts for microservices orchestration, treating infrastructure as a consumable API.  \n\n- Hashicorp’s Sentinel or OpenPolicyAgent  (OPA) show how policy-as-code integrates into such systems to enforce guardrails.  \n\n💡The Bottom Line  \n\nCloud engineers are evolving into cloud product developers. The future isn’t just writing IaC - it’s building systems that write IaC for you, at scale.  \n\n🙋‍♂️ Are you ready to shift from scripting infrastructure to engineering the machines that build it?\n\n#IaC #CloudEngineering #LandingZone #CloudFoundation #DevOps #PlatformEngineering #Innovation",

        "text": "In recent conversations with Russians living in Sweden, I’ve encountered a recurring argument: that rising European reservations toward Russia are rooted in well rooted “Russophobia.” \n\nWhile I respect the perspective, this narrative feels deeply incomplete. \n\nIt sidesteps critical context and ignores the legitimate concerns of nations that have lived in Russia’s shadow for centuries. \n\nLet’s speak plainly.  \n\nRussia is the world’s largest country, spanning 11 time zones, with a history marked by territorial expansion and domination of its neighbors. \n\nFrom the Tsarist era to the Soviet Union, its geopolitical playbook has long prioritized influence and control. \n\nUnder Putin, this pattern has not faded - it has intensified. \n\nThe annexation of Crimea, the war in Ukraine, cyberattacks, election interference, and the persistent rhetoric of reclaiming a “sphere of influence” are not figments of a prejudiced imagination. \n\nThey are documented actions that understandably unsettle nations valuing sovereignty and self-determination.  \n\nTo our Russian friends: \n\nEurope’s wariness is not born of hatred or envy. We admire your nation’s staggering cultural contributions - Dostoevsky’s existential depth, Tolstoy’s moral grandeur, Shostakovich’s haunting symphonies, and the scientific brilliance of minds like Mendeleev. \n\nWe have no claim to your land, resources, or wealth. All we ask is reciprocity.  \n\nYour closest neighbors - Ukraine, Georgia, the Baltic states, Moldova - have made their choice. They seek integration with Europe not out of malice toward Russia, but out of a desire for stability, democracy, and the freedom to chart their own futures. \n\nImagine the goodwill that could follow if Russia chose to champion diplomacy over coercion, collaboration over intimidation. \n\nEurope is not your enemy. We are neighbors, and neighbors deserve mutual respect.  \n\nThis is not about Russophobia. \n\nIt is about accountability. Nations that have endured centuries of domination - or decades of Soviet occupation - have every right to defend their independence. \n\nEurope’s stance is not an attack on Russian identity; it is a defense of the principles that keep peace on our continent.  \n\nTo my Russian friends: \n\nWe see your humanity, your creativity, your resilience. We do not conflate politics with people. But we cannot ignore the actions of a government that invades neighbors, suppresses dissent, and weaponizes disinformation. The path to trust begins with acknowledging these realities.  \n\nLet us move forward with clarity. \n\nEurope seeks no empire. \n\nWe ask only that Russia, too, steps back from the rhetoric of empire. The world has changed. It’s time to embrace a future where security is not zero-sum, where influence is earned through partnership, not force.  \n\nAs Dostoevsky wrote, “The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.” \n\nLet that “something” be peace.\n\n#russia #europe #ukraine #war #peace",

        "text": "🚀 Why Your 3-Year Product Roadmap is a Fantasy (And What to Do Instead)\n\nLet me tell you a story. \n\nEarly in my PM career, I spent weeks crafting a beautiful 3-year roadmap. \n\nIt had swimlanes, milestones, and outcomes mapped to the quarter. \n\nI presented it with pride. \n\nFast forward 6 months: priorities shifted, stakeholders pivoted, and market dynamics flipped. \n\nThat roadmap? \n\nA relic. \n\nA lesson learned: \n\nIn tech, rigidity is the enemy of progress.\n\nProduct management is messy. \n\nFor complex products with shifting dependencies, fluid markets, and ever-changing leadership priorities, expecting a crystal ball to plot exact timelines is laughable. \n\nWorse, it’s dangerous. \n\nCommit to dates too early, and you’ll either burn out teams rushing to meet arbitrary deadlines or lose credibility when reality (inevitably) derails the plan.  \n\nSo here’s my antidote: Ditch the calendar. \n\nThink in time chunks - Now, Next, Later.\n\n- NOW: What’s in flight today? What’s critical for the next 30-60 days? Focus on execution, blockers, and immediate outcomes.  \n\n- NEXT: What’s likely in the next 3-6 months? High-confidence bets, validated by stakeholder alignment and user research. Keep it directional, not granular.  \n\n- LATER: The vision. The North Star that guides decisions. No dates, just principles. Example: “Seamless omni-channel experience” or “AI-supported personalization at scale.”  \n\nThe reality bite? \n\nStakeholders don’t need false certainty. They need clarity on why we’re building, not exactly when. \n\nA key stakeholder once told me, “I don’t care if it takes 12 or 18 months - just show me we’re moving toward something that matters.”  \n\nSo, PMs: Stop rearranging Gantt charts. \n\nStart leading with vision, flexibility, and ruthless prioritization. \n\nYour team’s sanity (and your credibility) will thank you.  \n\n#ProductManagement #Agile #Leadership #Roadmapping*",

        "text": "🚨 Hot Take: Companies Don’t Have a Coordination Problem. They Have a Prioritization Problem.\n\nMost companies aren’t drowning because they can’t coordinate. \n\nThey’re drowning because they’re too afraid to say no. \n\nInternal politics. \n\nFear of competitors. \n\nFOMO disguised as “opportunity.” \n\nThe result? A chaotic sprawl of half-baked projects, overwhelmed teams, and a culture where everything is urgent but nothing is critical.  \n\nInstead of making hard choices, leaders default to hiring more “coordinators” to “align” the chaos. \n\nBut here’s the irony: \n\nMore coordinators = more meetings, more check-ins, more stress for already stressed-out teams. \n\nThe vicious cycle spins faster.  \n\nAs Greg McKeown wrote in Essentialism: “If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.”\n\nCompanies that fail to ruthlessly prioritize, surrender their strategy to the loudest voice in the room.  \n\nA Harvard Business Review study found that 94% of executives cite “poor prioritization” as the top barrier to strategic execution. \n\nNot lack of coordination. \n\nNot lack of talent. \n\nBut the inability to say NO.\n\nThe fix? \n\nStop hiring coordinators to paper over the problem. \n\nStart asking:  \n\n✅ What can we STOP doing?\n\n✅ What really moves the needle?\n\nClarity beats consensus.\n\nFocus beats frenzy.  \n\nYour teams aren’t stressed because they can’t coordinate. \n\nThey’re stressed because you’re asking them to do everything. \n\nBreak the cycle.  \n\n🔥 Drop the “maybe later.” \n\nStart with “no, for now..”\n\n#Leadership #Productivity #Strategy #BusinessGrowth #Essentialism #Priorities #coordination #meetings #reports #roadmaps #reporting",

        "text": "🚀 Kubernetes & Cloud Agnosticism: Cutting Through the Hype\n\nA while back, a colleague argued that deploying a third-party Kubernetes distro across public clouds is the ultimate solution to avoid vendor lock-in. \n\nWhile I agree Kubernetes is the de facto multicloud API, I pushed back on the rest. Here’s why:  \n\nThe Hidden Costs of \"Agnostic\" Kubernetes\n\nRunning a third-party K8s distro atop a cloud provider’s infrastructure would create unnecessary complexity without solving any real-world problems.  \n\n- Costly Expertise: \nConfiguring and maintaining standalone K8s demands rare (and expensive) skills. The CNCF’s 2023 survey found that 68% of organizations cite lack of expertise as a top barrier to Kubernetes adoption.\n\n- Lost Cloud-Native Benefits: \nBy sidestepping managed services (e.g., AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS), you forfeit built-in monitoring, logging, and security tools - forcing teams to rebuild these from scratch.  \n\n- Operational Overhead: \nGartner notes that 60% of multicloud teams struggle with inconsistent tooling, leading to fragmented workflows and slower incident response.  \n\nA Better Path: Own Your Code, Leverage the Cloud\n\nTrue portability isn’t about abstracting everything. \n\nIt’s about:  \n\n1. Owning Your Codebase: Ensure that you know the ins and outs of your applications including any dependencies.  \n\n2. Thin Kubernetes: Use cloud providers’ managed K8s without unnecessary and quirky customizations. Treat it as a commodity layer.  \n\n3. Embrace Cloud Ops Expertise: Let cloud providers handle scaling, upgrades, and security patching. Focus on what your team does best.  \n\nAs Kelsey Hightower said, “Kubernetes is a platform for building platforms. It’s not the final destination.”\n\nThe goal isn’t to reinvent the wheel but to build applications that can adapt to any cloud - without sacrificing efficiency.  \n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMulticloud agility comes from application design, not infrastructure gymnastics. \n\nBy keeping the cloud-specific glue to a minimum and maximizing code ownership, you retain flexibility and tap into the innovation (and budgets) of public clouds.  \n\nWhat about you? How are you balancing portability and practicality?\n\n#Kubernetes #CloudComputing #DevOps #Multicloud #TechStrategy",

The only thing left was focus: Finish. Don’t embarrass yourself.\n\nThe cold faintly lingered in my lungs. But step by step, I pushed. \n\nAnd when I crossed the line in 43:37, it wasn’t about the time - it was about proving that resilience beats resistance.  \n\nAs Muhammad Ali said, “The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses - behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights.”\n\nThis race was won in the quiet moments when doubt crept in… and I chose to keep going.  \n\nTo anyone facing a hurdle (literal or metaphorical): \n\nPersistence is a superpower.\n\nAnd sometimes, showing up - even when you’re not at 100% - is the bravest thing you can do.  \n\nA huge shoutout to the running community for the energy that lifts us all.

        "text": "When I was twelve, I was evacuated from wartime Sarajevo alongside my wounded father, mother, and younger sister. \n\nThe events of that day are blurry in my memory, but one moment remains crystalline: a Canadian UN peacekeeper handing me a red maple leaf flag patch. \n\nAmid the uncertainty: Would we make it to the plane? Would my father get better? that small gesture became an anchor. \n\nI carried that patch for years, stitching it onto a summer jacket I eventually outgrew. But its symbolism never faded.  \n\nThat soldier likely saw a terrified child and offered what he had: a piece of his country’s identity. \n\nTo him, it might have been a simple act of kindness. \n\nTo me, it was a reminder that humanity persists even in darkness. \n\nCanada, to a war-scarred kid, became synonymous with compassion, dignity, and quiet strength.  \n\nToday, as headlines dissect tensions between Canada and the U.S., I feel a deep unease.\n\nThe absurd idea of Canada’s maple leaf “absorbed” into another flag isn’t just political rhetoric - it’s a erasure of what that symbol represents. \n\nA nation built on multiculturalism, peacekeeping, and stewardship of the land. \n\nA neighbor whose global reputation is defined not by dominance, but by generosity: sharing its flag, its values, and its open hand with the world.  \n\nLosing Canada’s distinct identity wouldn’t just diminish North America - it would impoverish the world. \n\nThe U.S. would lose more than a trading partner; it would lose a friend who embodies what it means to lead with humility. \n\nCanada’s maple leaf isn’t just fabric. It’s a promise - one that gave a child in a warzone hope, and still reminds us that some nations choose to build bridges, not walls.  \n\nTo my Canadian friends: Your flag flies far beyond your borders. Never underestimate its power. 🌍🍁  \n\n#Canada #Peacekeeping #Gratitude #Leadership #InternationalRelations\n\n(Photo: Paul Lowe)",

        "text": "Yesterday morning, as I prepared to attend Women In Tech Stockholm, I felt an unexpected wave of nerves - more butterflies than I’ve ever had before a conference. \n\nWhy? \n\nThe reasons piled up: Some colleagues (both male and female) had asked, ”What will you do there?” My wife and daughter wondered the same. And then there was my own fear: ”Would I feel out of place?”\n\nThe only unwavering support came from my 12-year-old son and our incredible SEB #witswe2025 team.  \n\nI went anyway.  \n\nWalking in, I was immediately greeted by former female colleagues whose warmth eased my anxiety. \n\nAs the day unfolded, I began to relax, connect, and feel at home. \n\nBut one reality lingered: \n\nOf 3,000 attendees, only a small fraction were men. \n\nFor me, this was a single day of being in the minority - a fleeting glimpse into an experience my female colleagues navigate every day in the tech industry, which is often dominated by men.  \n\nIt was profoundly humbling.\n\nThe discomfort of standing out, the subtle weight of being an “outsider,” the quiet effort to belong - these are not occasional challenges for women in tech. \n\nThey’re constants. \n\nThe conference wasn’t just a reminder of the gender gap; it was a mirror held up to my own biases and privileges.  \n\nI left with two convictions:  \n\n1. Empathy grows in unfamiliar soil.\n👉 Stepping into spaces where we’re underrepresented reshapes perspective.  \n\n2. Allyship requires action.\n👉 It’s not enough to acknowledge inequality; we must actively listen, learn, and amplify marginalized voices.  \n\nTo the men in tech: Seek out experiences where you’re the minority. Sit with the discomfort. Let it teach you. \n\nOnly then can we truly understand the change we need to drive - and become better allies in the process.  \n\nHuge thanks to the Women In Tech Stockholm team for creating this amazing space filled with incredible people, energising topics and awesome mingle!\n\n#WomenInTech #DiversityAndInclusion #Allyship #TechForGood #witswe2025 #SEBTech #sebcloud",

        "text": "🚀 Application Modernization Isn’t Just About the Cloud – Let’s Talk Code Ownership & Engineering Excellence!\n\nWe’ve all heard the narrative: “Move to the cloud, and *poof* - your apps are modernized!” \n\nBut here’s the truth: the cloud is an enabler, not a magic wand. \n\nWhile it offers out-of-box simplicity, scalability and flexibility, modernizing applications starts long before you even think about hosting options. \n\nLet’s cut through the hype.  \n\n🛠️ Modernization Begins with Code Ownership  \n\nYou can’t modernize what you don’t understand!\n\nDeep knowledge of your codebase - its dependencies, quirks, and technical debt - is non-negotiable.\n\nAs Martin Fowler puts it: \n\n“Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.”\n\nWithout this mastery, teams risk compounding complexity, not reducing it. \n\nModernization demands ruthless prioritization: replacing obsolete libraries, decoupling monolithic architectures, and ensuring your app can run anywhere - whether on a Raspberry Pi, a VM, or the cloud.  \n\n⚙️ Engineering Practices > Infrastructure Choices  \n\nCloud migration without foundational engineering rigor is like building a mansion on sand. \n\nThe real accelerators, for example?\n\n- 12-Factor App Principles (Heroku): Decouple from environments, enable portability.  \n\n- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Catch issues early, reduce fragility.  \n\n- CI/CD Pipelines: Automate, iterate, and deploy with confidence.  \n\nGene Kim nails it: ”The goal is to amplify feedback loops so that teams can continuously improve their systems - and themselves.”\n\nThese practices create systems that are resilient, adaptable, and truly cloud-ready, regardless of where they’re hosted.  \n\n☁️ The Cloud Is Just the Icing, Not the Cake  \n\nYes, the cloud offers powerful and innovative tools: serverless, managed services, global scalability. \n\nBut starting with infrastructure-first thinking often backfires. \n\nGartner warns: \n\n”Through 2025, 70% of organizations that prioritize infrastructure modernization over application modernization will fail to meet their business goals.”\n\nRushing to the cloud without addressing code quality or architectural debt leads to soaring costs, vendor lock-in, and operational chaos. \n\n🔑 The Takeaway? Modernize Upstream First  \n\n1. Own Your Code: Audit, document, and refactor relentlessly.  \n\n2. Embed Engineering Excellence: Adopt TDD, CI/CD, and modular design.  \n\n3. ONLY THEN Choose Your Platform: Cloud, hybrid, or on-prem - your app will thrive.  \n\nAs software legend Joel Spolsky once said: ”All legacy code is somebody else’s mess. Until it’s yours.”\n\nModernization isn’t a destination - it’s a mindset. Let’s build systems that outlast the next tech trend! \n\n💬 Your turn: How are you balancing code ownership and cloud strategy?\n\n#DevOps #CloudComputing #SoftwareEngineering #EngineeringExcellence #AppModernization #InfraModernization",

It’s timeless yet ever-evolving - a potpourri of culture, grit, and grace. \n\nExactly the reset we needed from the daily grind and global noise.  \n\nGrateful for the chaos, the cuddles, and the clarity that comes from swapping routines for adventures. 🙌  \n\n“The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.” – Saint Augustine\n\nTill next time, London.

        "text": "We’re witnessing a high-stakes digital chicken race. \n\nWhile headlines fixate on tit-for-tat tariffs, Beijing is quietly executing a decadelong masterplan to achieve something far more strategic: tech independence.\n\nThe goal? Rewire the global supply chain so China’s digital future isn’t held hostage by foreign chips, software, or data rules.  \n\nHere’s how they’re doing it:  \n\n🇨🇳 China’s Digital Sovereignty Blueprint\n\n1️⃣ Policy Muscle 💪 \n\n- “Made in China 2025”: Billions poured into semiconductors, AI, and 5G to break foreign monopolies.  \n\n- Data Localization Laws: Critical sectors like finance and energy must use domestic infrastructure and comply with strict cross-border data rules.  \n\n- Phase-Out Deadlines: Foreign software (e.g., Microsoft, Oracle) to be replaced in government systems by 2027.  \n\n2️⃣ Homegrown Tech Ecosystems \n\n- Hardware: Loongson CPUs, SMIC chips, and Huawei’s HarmonyOS challenge Intel, TSMC, and Android. \n\n- Cloud & Software: Alibaba Cloud and Tencent now dominate Asia-Pacific markets, displacing AWS and Azure.  \n\n- Own Standards: BeiDou (China’s GPS alternative) and 5G patents aim to rewrite global tech rules.  \n\n3️⃣ The Big Sticking Points\n\n- Semiconductor Struggles: Despite state funding, China still imports 70% of high-end chips. US sanctions on ASML EUV machines are a major bottleneck.  \n\n- Ecosystem Gaps: Replacing Windows/Android isn’t just about OSs – it’s about rebuilding app stores, developer networks, and user trust.  \n\n💡 Key Takeaways for Global Leaders\n\n- Tech Decoupling is Expensive… but possible with state-private alignment. China’s 5G and fintech leaps prove this.  \n\n- Ecosystems > Individual Products: Success requires parallel investments in hardware, software, talent, and standards. \n\n- The Innovation Dilemma: Cutting foreign ties risks isolating domestic tech from global breakthroughs (e.g., AI, quantum).  \n\nAs Europe discusses #digitalsovereignty and India pushes for “Atmanirbhar” (self-reliance), China’s journey underscores a harsh truth: \n\nDigital sovereignty may not be optional. But at what cost?  \n\nYour thoughts?\n\n- Is self-sufficiency achievable without stifling innovation?  \n\n- How should democracies balance own security and global collaboration?  \n\nLet’s discuss! 👇  \n\n#DigitalSovereignty #Geopolitics #TechStrategy #Innovation #ChinaTech  \n\n(Sources: State Council policies, CSIS reports, Reuters, Caixin – DM for links!)",

Do they push themselves - and others - to be their best selves?”\n\nYour legacy isn’t what you achieve - it’s what your people achieve long after you have left the room and/or company.\n\nIf you don’t invest in coaching, mentoring, and lifting others, how will they ever lift your shared vision? \n\nTwo great quotes to underline this. \n\n👉 “Leadership is not about being in charge. It’s about taking care of those in your charge.” - Simon Sinek  \n\n👉 “People will forget what you said, but they’ll never forget how you made them feel.” - Maya Angelou  \n\nBe the leader who lights the way, and be generous with the spotlight! \n\nBecause when you grow your people, you grow everything. 🚀  \n\nHow are you shaping your legacy today?\n\n#LeadershipLegacy #PeopleFirst #LeadWithHeart #GrowthMindset  \n\nP.S. Your team’s success is your success. Are you giving your team members the tools - and the trust - to soar?",

Left it running. Went about my day. Slept. 😴  \n\n🔥 By 2:30 AM, costs had gone 500% OVER budget…  \n\nBut here’s the hero twist: Our guardrails auto-slammed the brakes, disconnecting billing the second thresholds were breached. \n\nNo financial freefall. \n\nJust a cold, hard reminder:  \n\n👉 \"Without guardrails, even experts become cautionary tales.\"\n\nThis wasn’t just a “whoops” moment - it was a live-fire test of why enterprises must have:  \n\n✅ Real-time cost monitoring\n\n✅ Auto-kill switches for runaway spend  \n\n✅ Cloud budgets tighter than a drum\n\nMoral of the story?  \n\nTrust, but verify.

        "text": "Are You Beating a Dead Horse? Why Letting Go May Be the Smartest Move! \n\nWe’ve all been there - pouring time, money, and energy into a project, strategy, or relationship that’s clearly no longer working. \n\nThe Dakota Indians had a simple yet elegant solution for this: \n\n“When you discover you’re riding a dead horse, dismount.”\n\nYet, modern organizations often double down with absurd “solutions” like buying a stronger whip, forming committees, or - my personal favorite - providing additional funding and/or training to increase the dead horse’s performance.  \n\nThe Dead Horse Theory isn’t just funny - it’s painfully accurate.\n\nThe metaphor exposes our tendency to cling to sunk costs. \n\nInstead of cutting losses, we:  \n\n- Throw resources at the problem. \n- Blame people.\n- Mask reality with jargon. \n\nWhy do we do this?\n\nFear of failure, bureaucratic inertia, or ego. \n\nBut the cost is steep: wasted time, demoralized teams, and stagnation. \n\nAs the list jokes, ”declaring that as the dead horse doesn’t have to be fed, it is less costly” doesn’t magically make it profitable - it just delays the inevitable.  \n\nDismounting takes courage however. \n\nHere’s how to do it: \n\n1. Acknowledge the horse is dead. Ask: “If we started fresh, would we invest in this?”\n\n2. Reward agility, not stubbornness. Celebrate teams that pivot, not just those who “persevere.”  \n\n3. Kill the jargon. Call failure what it is! See it as a welcome chance to redirect efforts where they can give better returns.  \n\nIn innovation, the first step to progress isn’t moving faster - it’s stopping what doesn’t work. \n\nSo, next time you’re tempted to hire a consultant to ride that dead horse, ask yourself: \n\n👉 Is it time to dismount? 🐎\n\nLeadership isn’t about saving face. It’s about making smart exits - so you can find a horse that can take you places!\n\nAgree? Share your “dead horse” stories (we’ve all got ’em) in the comments. 🐴💀  \n\n#Leadership #BusinessStrategy #Innovation #FailFast #SunkCostFallacy",

        "text": "🚨 Why Learn the Hard Way?\n\nTolstoy once wrote: ”All happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”\n\nThe same applies to cloud migrations.\n\nSuccessful ones follow similar patterns. But failures? Each is a unique cautionary tale. And that’s where the real lessons lie.  \n\nTake UniSuper, a massive Australian fund. \n\nTheir 2024 cloud meltdown (yes, an entire account was accidentally deleted) made headlines. But the real story started earlier.  \n\nIn 2023, they were racing toward a “record-fast” cloud migration.\n\nTheir strategy? Familiarity over reinvention:  \n\n- ✅ ”Minimal effort and disruption… greater scale and agility.”\n\n- ✅ “Technology the team is already used to… no need to rebuild apps.”\n\n- ✅ “Get into the cloud quickly and safely.”\n\nSound smart? On paper, yes. \n\nBut here’s the truth: Shortcuts don’t eliminate hard work - they just delay it. \n\nEven without the catastrophic deletion, their approach would’ve backfired. \n\nAvoiding cloud-native architecture? \n\nSkipping app modernization? \n\nThat debt always comes due. IT sprawl, hidden costs, scalability walls - it’s not if, but when. \n\nThe takeaway?\n\nCloud migrations aren’t just about speed or sticking with what’s familiar. \n\nThey’re about doing the foundational work - even when it’s painful.  \n\nWhat’s your take? Have you seen “shortcuts” blow up later?\n\n#cloudmigration #digitaltransformation #techstrategy #learningfromfailure #cloudtransformation\n\nP.S.

        "text": "🚀 \"Get the Right People on the Bus\" – A Leadership Lesson\n\nEarly in my engineering management career, I inherited a team focused on administrative work (alongside my platform engineering team focused on CI/CD tools and practices). \n\nOne of the members on the new team quickly “warned” me: ”Most people here just want a paycheck and to clock out early. Don’t expect much commitment or passion.”\n\nMy gut said otherwise. \n\nSure, some resisted change - but indifferent? \n\nI refused to believe that. \n\nLater, I realized this “advice” was part of the play for the team member to paint themselves as the given team lead - an idea that had been planted by the prior manager. \n\nBut the seed of doubt lingered: \n\nCould some truly be unmotivated?\n\nI pushed hard. \n\nI rallied for change, emphasized purpose, and celebrated small wins. \n\nYet, a few remained disengaged. \n\nThe breakthrough came not from persuasion, but evolution. \n\nAs some team members moved on, we recruited believers - people who thrived on ownership, change and operational excellence. \n\nA core formed, blending tenured and new members, all invested in the mission.  \n\nJim Collins nailed it: ”Get the right people on the bus.”\n\nSuccess wasn’t about forcing buy-in; it was about fostering a team that wanted to drive.  \n\nLesson learned: Cynicism often masks hidden agendas - or mismatched roles. \n\nAs leaders, we don’t just manage people; we curate cultures. \n\nWhen you align purpose with the right talent, “indifferent” teams transform into engines of impact.  \n\n#Leadership #TeamBuilding #ChangeManagement #EngineeringLeadership #GrowthMindset\n\nP.S. If you're wondering what was Marval and why it was being killed, it was an ITSM software that the team rallied around to replace for Jira that was a much better fit with the company and our ways of working. D.S.\n\nP.P.S. A well deserved shoutout to the amazing NetEnt Change Management team that drove and made possible much needed change of the process, tooling and ways of working: Robert Hallam, Johanna Bäckström, Ann-Charlotte Ekstedt and Johanna Furborg!

However, one woman in tech has inspired me more than any other: my mother.  \n\nIn her late thirties, after working in accounting for half her life, my mother decided to make a career change and dive into the world of computers. This was in the 1990s, and I vividly remember our discussions about whose turn it was to use the family PC.  \n\nWhile my mom had a natural technical inclination and curiosity, I still recall the countless evenings she spent poring over course materials, determined to understand how everything worked.  \n\nHer hard work, late nights, and dedication to learning eventually paid off. She went on to spend the rest of her career as a systems administrator and a computer teacher at an elementary school, retiring just a few years ago.  \n\nHer relentless drive, her enduring thirst for learning about computers and technology, and her patience in experimenting and mastering new skills have left a lasting impression on me.  \n\nI’m now truly excited for this year’s #WIT conference and the opportunity to reconnect with old colleagues and meet new ones. \n\nSee you at Women in Tech 2025!\n\n#womenintech #sebtech #seblife #lifeatseb",

        "text": "St. Patrick’s story of resilience, unity, and transformation holds powerful lessons for modern Europe. \n\nSt. Patrick, born in Britain, was kidnapped at 16 and enslaved in Ireland. \n\nAfter escaping, he became a priest and returned to Ireland to spread Christianity. \n\nUsing the shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity, he united people and built churches. \n\nHis resilience, faith, and mission to bring people together made him Ireland’s patron saint. \n\nAs a figure who bridged divides and turned adversity into opportunity, his legacy resonates deeply in a continent facing challenges.  \n\n✅ Resilience: Europe has weathered many crises and faces many more. Like St. Patrick, who turned his struggles into strength, Europe continues to adapt and rebuild.  \n\n✅ Unity: St. Patrick used the shamrock to explain unity in diversity - an important lesson for Europe’s multicultural societies. In a time of division, fostering connection is more important than ever.  \n\n✅ Transformation: Just as St. Patrick transformed Ireland, Europe is evolving by embracing sustainability, innovation, and inclusion to shape a better future.  \n\nSt. Patrick’s message? ”Turn challenges into opportunities, and build bridges, not walls.\" \n\nLet us together carry that spirit forward.  \n\nHappy St. Patrick’s Day!🍀 \n\n#StPatricksDay #Europe #Resilience #Unity #Transformation\n\nPS I hope you remembered to wear green today. As the tradition goes, wearing green on St. Patrick's Day is supposed to make you invisible to #leprechauns. They will pinch you as soon as you come upon their radar if you don't wear green! DS",

        "text": "🚀 The CI/CD Conundrum: Why Are Only 40% of Applications Delivered Using CI/CD? 🤔\n\nA few months ago, I had a fascinating conversation with Richard Seroter, and one statistic he shared has been living rent-free in my head ever since: \n\nONLY 40% of applications globally are delivered to production using CI/CD.\n\nJust think about it! \n\nAs someone who’s been knee-deep in the continuous delivery space for over 9 years, this number surprised me. \n\nBack in 2016, my team and I took our first leap into CI/CD with a Java-based monolith running on a RedHat Linux VM. \n\nBefore CI/CD, delivering our platform to hundreds of customers took us a year, give or take.\n\nAfter CI/CD? \n\nWe were shipping new versions several times a year. The difference was night and day.\n\nBut let’s rewind to the pre-CI/CD days for a moment. \n\nRemember manual deployments? \n\nOh, the horror! I recall well our 47-step checklists (yes, 47!) to push an update to production. \n\nOne missed step, and boom - our platform would go down faster than a Jenga tower in an earthquake. \n\nThere was this one time when someone accidentally skipped step 23 (restarting the server), and we spent the next 2 hours troubleshooting why the application was “acting weird.” Spoiler: it wasn’t the application; it was us. 😅\n\nOr how about the time we deployed a critical hotfix at 2 a.m., only to realize we’d forgotten to include a configuration file? \n\nPicture the frantic Slack messages, groggy engineers, and a lot of coffee. \n\nIt was like a bad sitcom episode, except no one was laughing.\n\nCI/CD changed all that. \n\nIt wasn’t just about speed; it was about reliability, repeatability, and sanity.\n\nAs Martin Fowler famously said, \n\n”Continuous Delivery is a series of practices that reduce the friction of releasing software.”\n\nAnd boy, did it reduce friction. \n\nSuddenly, deployments weren’t a white-knuckle, all-hands-on-deck affair. They were routine, predictable, and - dare I say it - boring. And that’s exactly how we wanted it.\n\nSo, why are only 40% of applications delivered using CI/CD? 🤷‍♂️ \n\nIs it legacy systems holding us back? \n\nFear of change? \n\nLack of tooling? \n\nWhatever the reason, it’s clear there’s still a lot of room for improvement. \n\nIf you’re part of the 60% still on the fence, let me tell you: the grass is greener on the CI/CD side. \n\nAnd if you’re already there, share your favorite CI/CD war stories in the comments.\n\n#DevOps #CIDC #ContinuousDelivery #SoftwareEngineering #WarStories #TechHumor",

        "text": "Adolf Hitler's dismantling of democracy in Germany occurred decisively after he was appointed Chancellor on January 30, 1933. \n\nOver the next 53 days, he and the Nazi Party used a combination of legal maneuvers, propaganda, intimidation, and violence to consolidate power. \n\nBelow is a timeline of key events:\n\n👉 Jan 30, 1933: Hitler Appointed Chancellor\n\n- President Paul von Hindenburg appoints Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, believing he can be controlled by conservative politicians.\n- Hitler leads a coalition government, with the Nazis holding only a few key positions.\n\n👉 Feb 1, 1933: Reichstag Dissolved\n\n- Hitler convinces Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag and call for new elections on March 5, 1933, aiming to secure a Nazi majority.\n\n👉 Feb 4, 1933: Decree for the Protection of the German People\n\n- Hitler issues a decree restricting press freedom and public gatherings, targeting political opponents, especially communists and socialists.\n- This allows the Nazis to suppress opposition voices and control the narrative.\n\n👉 Feb 27, 1933: Reichstag Fire\n\n- The Reichstag building is set on fire. A Dutch communist, Marinus van der Lubbe, is arrested and blamed for the fire.\n- Hitler uses the fire as a pretext to claim that Germany is under threat from a communist uprising.\n\n👉 Feb 28, 1933: Reichstag Fire Decree\n\n- Hindenburg signs the \"Decree for the Protection of the People and the State\", which suspends civil liberties:\n  - Freedom of speech, press, and assembly are abolished.\n  - Warrants for arrests and searches are no longer required.\n  - The decree allows the Nazis to arrest and detain political opponents, particularly communists, without trial.\n\n👉 Mar 5, 1933: Reichstag Elections\n\n- The Nazi Party wins 43.9% of the vote, gaining 288 seats in the Reichstag but falling short of a majority.\n- Hitler forms a coalition with the nationalist DNVP party, giving him a slim majority.\n- The Nazis use intimidation, violence, and propaganda to influence the election results.\n\n👉 Mar 8-12, 1933: Seizure of State Governments\n\n- Nazi officials take control of state governments across Germany, using force and coercion to replace elected officials with Nazi loyalists.\n- This centralizes power under Hitler's regime.\n\n👉 Mar 23, 1933: Enabling Act (Ermächtigungsgesetz)\n\n- The Reichstag passes the Enabling Act, which grants Hitler the power to enact laws without parliamentary approval.\n- The act effectively ends democracy in Germany, allowing Hitler to rule by decree.\n- The Nazis use intimidation and violence to ensure the act's passage, arresting communist deputies and pressuring others to vote in favor.\n\nThis 53-day period marks the rapid transformation of Germany from a fragile democracy to a totalitarian dictatorship under Hitler's rule. \n\nThe Enabling Act, in particular, serves as the legal foundation for Nazi dictatorship, allowing Hitler to bypass the constitution and rule unchecked.\n\n#historydoesntrepeatitselfbutitoftenrhymes",

        "text": "Leadership isn’t defined by the easy days. It’s defined by how you handle the hard ones. \n\nThe moments that keep you up at night - letting people go, conducting salary reviews, giving feedback on behavior or performance - these are the moments that separate great leaders from the rest.  \n\nHere’s the truth: there’s no way to dodge the hard stuff.\n\nAvoiding tough conversations doesn’t make them disappear; it only makes things worse. \n\nPeople deserve clarity, honesty, and respect - whether you’re celebrating their wins or addressing their challenges.  \n\nWhat I’ve learned over the years:  \n\n✅ Positive feedback should be immediate and public. Celebrate wins as soon as they happen - it fuels motivation and builds trust.  \n\n✅ Negative feedback should be private and respectful. It’s not about tearing someone down; it’s about helping them grow.  \n\n✅ Every situation is different. People are unique, and their reactions will vary. Adaptability and empathy are key.  \n\nAs leaders, we have to lean into the discomfort. \n\nIt’s not easy, but it’s necessary. \n\nAs Brene Brown once said, “Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind.”\n\nAnd Simon Sinek reminds us that \n\n“Leadership is not about being in charge. It’s about taking care of those in your charge.”\n\nSo, let’s commit to showing up - fully, honestly, and with compassion - even when it’s hard. \n\nBecause that’s what great leadership is all about.  \n\nWhat’s the hardest leadership lesson you’ve learned?  \n\n#Leadership #HardConversations #FeedbackCulture #EmpathyInLeadership #GrowthMindset",

No. \n\nHave there been moments where it led to setbacks? Absolutely. \n\nBut I’ve never regretted staying authentic and fighting for what I believe is right - always with respect for others and the best interests of the society and company at heart.  \n\nAs Jonathan says in the book: \n\n“Well, then they would've caught Lionheart and not a piece of dirt.” 💪  \n\nI’d rather face challenges as my true self than compromise on my core principles. \n\nHere’s to embracing courage, staying authentic, and standing up for what matters - even when the stakes are high.  \n\nLet’s all strive to be Lionhearts in our work and lives. 🦁✨  \n\n#Authenticity #Leadership #Courage #Values #TheBrothersLionheart #Integrity",

        "text": "Meetings. The word alone sends shivers down the spine of even the most seasoned professional. \n\nThey are the corporate world’s double-edged sword: a necessary evil for collaboration, yet often a black hole of productivity. \n\nAs someone who is fairly caught up in meetings, I’ve come to view them with a healthy dose of skepticism. \n\nIf a meeting lacks a clear agenda, purpose, or actionable outcomes, it’s not a meeting - it’s a time-wasting ritual.\n\nLet’s face it: not every problem requires a meeting. \n\nAs Jason Fried, co-founder of Basecamp, once said, “Meetings are the graveyards of productivity.”\n\nToo often, they are called out of habit, not necessity. \n\nThe result? A room full of people nodding along, half-listening, while their to-do lists grow longer by the minute. \n\nAnd don’t even get me started on back-to-back meetings. These are the ultimate productivity killers, leaving no room for breathing, let alone thinking.\n\nThe human brain isn’t designed to switch contexts every 30 minutes. \n\nCal Newport, author of “Deep Work”, argues that meaningful productivity requires uninterrupted focus. \n\nBack-to-back meetings fracture your day into tiny shards, leaving you exhausted but unaccomplished. \n\nYou end up as a meeting zombie 🧟 - physically present but mentally checked out, with a mountain of action points and no time to tackle them.\n\nSo, how do we fight this meeting inflation? \n\nStart by asking the hard questions: “Does this meeting need to happen? What’s the goal? What’s the agenda? What actions may come out of it?” \n\nIf you can’t answer these, cancel the meeting. Period. \n\nDon’t let your calendar become a battleground of inefficiency.\n\nNext, build slack into your day. \n\nWhether you call it thinking time, reflection time, or just plain old work time, it’s essential. \n\nWithout it, you’re just a cog in the machine, grinding away without purpose. \n\nAs Anne Lamott wisely put it, “Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.” \n\nGive yourself the space to recharge, prioritize, and actually get things done.\n\nIn the end, meetings should serve us, not the other way around. \n\nA life spent in meetings isn’t a life - it’s a slow descent into zombiehood. And no one wants to be a meeting zombie. 🧟‍♂️",

What started as playful monkeying around has now evolved into something much more meaningful. He’s begun to take it almost as seriously as I do! 💪  \n\nOur routine is simple:  \n- A warmup on the treadmill to get started.  \n- Lifting free weights together.\n\nWhat began as fun and games has turned into a commitment - at least for the first 30 minutes! 😄 \n\nWatching him improve his technique week after week fills me with an incredible sense of pride and accomplishment.  \n\nBeyond teaching him the basics of weightlifting, my real ambition is to create memories and spend quality time together. \n\nIn fact these sessions are about more than just fitness; they’re about connection, growth, and shared goals.  \n\n#Fitness #Parenting #QualityTime #Weightlifting #FamilyGoals #GrowthMindset",

        "text": "The Tito-Stalin Split of 1948 and the #Russian invasion of #Ukraine share some parallels, particularly in terms of power dynamics, national sovereignty, and resistance to external domination. \n\n👉 #Struggle for #National #Sovereignty\n\n- #Yugoslavia sought to maintain its independence from #Soviet control, asserting its right to pursue its own path to socialism. #Tito resisted Stalin's attempts to dictate Yugoslavia's domestic and foreign policies.\n \n- Ukraine has similarly sought to assert its sovereignty and independence from Russian influence, particularly since the #Euromaidan #Revolution in 2014. Ukraine's desire to integrate with Western institutions has been a direct challenge to Russia's vision of a sphere of influence in the post-Soviet era.\n\n👉 #Resistance to #Hegemonic #Control\n\n- #Stalin viewed Tito's independence as a threat to the unity of the communist bloc and his own authority as the leader of global communism. He attempted to undermine Tito through propaganda, espionage, and pressure on other Eastern Bloc countries to isolate Yugoslavia.\n\n- Russia, under Vladimir #Putin, views Ukraine's pro-Western orientation as a threat to its own hegemony in the region. Russia has used a combination of military aggression (e.g., the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion in 2022), propaganda, and economic pressure to undermine Ukraine's independence.\n\n👉 #Ideological and #Cultural Dimensions\n\n- Yugoslavia promoted a unique form of #socialism (e.g., workers' self-management) and a multi-ethnic, federal state structure. This stood in contrast to Stalin's rigid, centralized model of socialism and his emphasis on Soviet dominance.\n\n- Ukraine's pursuit of democracy, European integration, and a distinct national identity contrasts sharply with Russia's authoritarian model and its claims of a shared \"Russian world\" (#Russkiy #Mir) that includes Ukraine. Ukraine's cultural and linguistic revival, particularly since 2014, has been a direct challenge to Russia's historical narrative of Ukraine as part of a greater Russian sphere.\n\n👉 #Propaganda and #Disinformation\n\n- Stalin launched a propaganda campaign against Tito, accusing him of betraying socialism and being a \"fascist\" and \"imperialist agent.\" This was an attempt to discredit Tito and justify Yugoslavia's isolation.\n\n- Russia has used extensive propaganda and disinformation to portray Ukraine as a \"fascist\" state, particularly since the Euromaidan Revolution. This narrative has been used to justify Russian #aggression and undermine Ukraine's legitimacy on the global stage.\n\nThe parallels between the Tito-Stalin Split and the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlight recurring themes of national sovereignty, resistance to external domination, and the struggle for independence in the face of hegemonic powers. \n\nBoth cases demonstrate the challenges smaller nations face when asserting their independence against larger, more powerful neighbors.\n\n#slavaukraini",

What I’ve learned, though, is that true strength lies in embracing them.  \n\n“I don’t know” is not just clarity - it’s a gateway to trust, transparency, and new perspectives. \n\nIt sets the tone for honest conversations and invites collaboration. As the saying goes, \n\n“The wisest mind has something yet to learn.”\n\nOf course, these words are most impactful when followed by context and curiosity. \n\nThey’re not an endpoint but a starting point for growth.  \n\nHere’s to embracing the power of “I don’t know” and the opportunities it unlocks. \n\nWhat’s a moment when admitting this led to something transformative for you?  \n\n#Leadership #GrowthMindset #Transparency #Trust",

        "text": "As I scroll through my LinkedIn feed, the calls for #European #digitalsovereignty are growing louder, and for good reasons. \n\nWith shifting geopolitical dynamics, Europe must step up as a bastion of democratic values and technological autonomy. \n\nBut how do we achieve digital sovereignty in practice? \n\nThe path is neither simple nor quick, and it begins with a fundamental shift in how we approach technology - starting with conscious #dependencymanagement. \n\nAt its core, digital sovereignty is about autonomy - the ability to control where and how our digital systems operate. But autonomy starts with visibility. \n\nIf we don’t understand what goes into our applications - from libraries and binaries to APIs and external integrations - we’re effectively locked into the ecosystems where those applications run.  \n\nConscious dependency management means having full #visibility into every component of an application. It means knowing:  \n\n- What #libraries and #frameworks are being used?\n\n- Where are #binaries and #images sourced from?\n\n- What external #APIs or #services are integrated?\n\n- How do these dependencies impact the application’s #portability and #adaptability?\n\nWhen you have this level of insight, you’re in a better position to modify, adapt, and migrate your applications as needed. \n\nHowever, dependency management is often seen as a back-end, technical concern - one that doesn’t directly impact revenue or customer experience.\n\nAs a result, many companies only address dependencies when they’re forced to - during a #migration, a #security breach, or a #compliance audit. \n\nBy then, it’s often too late to make meaningful changes without significant cost and disruption.  \n\nSo, how do we shift this mindset and make dependency management a priority? \n\nHere are a few steps to consider:  \n\n1. Educate and Advocate: \nStart by raising awareness about the importance of dependency management. Explain how it ties into broader goals like digital sovereignty, security, and #resilience.\n\n2. Invest in Tools and Processes: \nImplement tools that provide visibility into application dependencies. From software composition analysis (SCA) to API #monitoring, there are solutions available to help you map out your application’s ecosystem.  \n\n3. Embed Dependency Management into Development: \nMake dependency management a core part of your #softwaredevelopmentlifecycle (SDLC). Encourage developers to document dependencies, evaluate alternatives, and prioritize #opensource where possible.  \n\n4. Foster a Culture of Ownership: Dependency management isn’t the sole responsibility of IT or security teams. It’s a #sharedresponsibility that requires buy-in from leadership, developers, and operations teams alike.  \n\nAchieving digital sovereignty won’t happen overnight. It will require sustained effort, investment, and collaboration. \n\nBut by starting with conscious dependency management, we can lay the groundwork for a more autonomous, resilient, and sovereign digital future.",

        "text": "In the modern world, identity is no longer tied to a single place, culture, or role. \n\nWe are born in one corner of the globe, educated in another, and propelled by work, love, or sheer curiosity to yet another. \n\nThis fluidity of identity isn’t a new phenomenon - it’s as old as human history itself. \n\nTake Marco Polo, for instance. Regardless if born in Venice or the Croatian island of Korčula, he ventured across continents, not just to trade goods but to exchange ideas, cultures, and stories. \n\nHis journey wasn’t just about geography; it was about transformation.\n\nAs he once said, “I did not tell half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed.”\n\nHis words resonate deeply in today’s interconnected world. \n\nHow many of us have felt the same? We move, we adapt, we grow, and sometimes our experiences feel too vast to articulate. \n\nYet, it’s in this fluidity that we find our true strength.\n\nToday, we are all Marco Polos in our own right. \n\nWe’re born in one place, study in another, and build careers in yet another. We fall in love with people, cultures, and opportunities that take us far from our roots. And in doing so, we redefine what it means to belong.\n\nEach of us carries a unique story, a mosaic of experiences that shapes our identity.\n\nAs one of my friends once told me, \n\n“Home isn’t where you’re born; it’s where you become yourself.”\n\nThis sentiment captures the essence of our modern journeys. \n\nWe are not defined by a single place or role but by the sum of our experiences.\n\nMarco Polo’s story reminds us that adaptation is the key to thriving in a fluid world. \n\nHe didn’t just survive his journey - he thrived by embracing the unknown. \n\nHe learned new languages, built relationships across cultures, and found opportunity in the unfamiliar.\n\nIn today’s world, adaptability is our greatest asset. \n\nWhether it’s learning a new skill, navigating a career pivot, or building a life in a new country, our ability to adapt defines our success.\n\nLinkedIn is the modern Silk Road - a platform where ideas, opportunities, and stories intersect. \n\nIt’s where a professional in New York can collaborate with a startup in Nairobi, or where someone in Tokyo can find mentorship from an expert in Berlin. \n\nOur profiles may list our current roles, but our stories are so much richer.\n\nSo, to all the modern Marco Polos out there: your journey matters!\n\nYour fluid identity is not a limitation - it’s your superpower! \n\nShare your story, embrace the unknown, and remember that every step you take adds to the richness of your narrative.\n\nAs I reflect on my own journey - born in one country, educated in another, having built a career that spans industries and borders - I’m reminded of the power of connection. \n\nLet’s continue to learn from each other and celebrate the beauty of our fluid identities.\n\nWhat’s your Marco Polo story?\n\n#identity #careerjourney #adaptibility #marcopolo #globalcitizen #growthmindset\n\nPS.

        "text": "I don’t see eye to eye with all of Milton Friedman’s teachings but this one hits the nail on the head.\n\nMilton Friedman’s boat analogy is one of his most famous explanations of #freetrade. \n\nHe used it to illustrate the self-destructive nature of protectionism and why restricting trade harms a country’s own economy.\n\nImagine a country is like a boat. The boat has a hole in it, and water is leaking in. \n\nThat hole represents tariffs, quotas, and protectionist policies that make trade inefficient and harm economic growth.\n\nNow, suppose other countries also have boats with holes in them - meaning they, too, impose protectionist measures.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\n- A protectionist would argue: “Other boats have holes, so we should drill more holes in our own boat to be ‘fair’ and ‘competitive’!”\n\n- Friedman argues: “The rational response is to plug the holes in your own boat and make it as seaworthy as possible - regardless of what other boats do!”\n\nFriedman’s analogy explains that just because other countries impose tariffs and trade restrictions doesn’t mean your country should do the same. \n\nRetaliatory tariffs only hurt domestic consumers by making goods more expensive and less efficient. \n\nInstead of engaging in economic self-harm, a country should embrace free trade even if others don’t - because free trade benefits consumers and businesses alike.\n\nIn short, drilling more holes in your boat to match someone else’s isn’t strategy - it’s self-sabotage.",

        "text": "What skills should infrastructure engineers focus on in 2025?\n\nI was asked this recently and my answer was:\n\n\t1.\tInfrastructure as Code\n\t2.\tCI/CD\n\t3.\tCloud\n\nI think I surprised the person asking - #Cloud came third, and there was nothing about #AI!\n\nHere’s my reasoning:\n\n👉 Infrastructure as Code (#IaC) – Whether on-prem, hybrid, or fully cloud, treating infrastructure as code is non-negotiable. \n\nEngineers who master #Terraform, #Pulumi, or some other infrastructure coding language are setting themselves up for long-term success. \n\n👉 CI/CD – Infrastructure should be delivered just like application code - with automation, pipelines, and testing. \n\nUnderstanding build and deployment automation is key to reliability and speed.\n\n👉 Cloud – Knowing AWS/GCP/Azure is important, but #engineering skills unlock cloud’s real value. \n\nSimply knowing which services exist doesn’t provide as much leverage as knowing how to provision, automate, and deploy effectively.\n\nNow what about #AI?\n\nAI/ML will shape infrastructure, but for now, AI is a tool, not a core competence for infrastructure engineers. \n\nAI-driven #automation (AIOps, cost optimization, auto-remediation) is worth exploring, but mastering engineering fundamentals first is the real differentiator.\n\nIf I could add more:\n\n 👉 Observability & Resilience – Metrics, distributed tracing, and failure recovery patterns are key to reliability.\n\n👉 Security & Compliance as Code – With growing regulations, embedding security directly into infrastructure workflows is critical.\n\nThese skills future-proof infrastructure engineers, no matter where technology trends go.\n\nIs there anything you would add to the list?",

        "text": "Why Isn't Cloud Carbon Data Standardized? 🌍☁️\n\nCloud providers love to talk about sustainability, but I have noticed that not all Cloud providers publish aligned, comparable carbon data across their regions and data centers. \n\nRight now, I reckon that two fairly simple metrics would bring increased transparency and set a common standard: \n\n- CFE% (Carbon-Free Energy Percentage) – How much of a data center’s energy comes from clean sources?\n\n- Grid Carbon Intensity (gCO2eq/kWh) – How much CO₂ is emitted per unit of electricity consumed?\n\nWith these two metrics, it becomes quite easy to calculate the actual impact of one's own cloud consumption. \n\nStill, in my experience, each provider reports differently, or doesn't disclose all data per respective region - making it impossible to make qualified comparisons. \n\nIs this simply because Cloud providers do not wish to be compared, or is there something else at play?\n\n#cloudcomputing #sustainability #CFE #carbontransparency #esg #carbonfootprint #azure #aws #gcp",

        "text": "Just finished the audiobook “How the Mighty Fall” by #Jim #Collins, and I found it quite insightful. \n\nCollins doesn’t just diagnose organizational failure; he provides concrete cues for how to detect and potentially reverse decline. \n\nThe author outlines five stages of decline, describing how successful organizations falter and, in some cases, fail completely. \n\nHere’s a breakdown of the stages:\n\n1️⃣ Hubris Born of Success\n\nSuccess leads to overconfidence and arrogance. Leaders start to take their success for granted, assuming their strategies will always work.\n\nKey signs:\n- Ignoring the fundamentals that initially drove success.\n- Believing the organization is “too big to fail.”\n- Losing focus on the core mission or customers.\n\n2️⃣ Undisciplined Pursuit of More\n\nThe organization overreaches, chasing growth, diversification, or success in areas outside its strengths.\n\nKey signs:\n- Expanding too quickly without strategic discipline.\n- Pursuing growth at the expense of quality or long-term sustainability.\n- Neglecting the core business or what the organization does best.\n\n3️⃣ Denial of Risk and Peril\n\nLeaders fail to recognize warning signs and dismiss evidence of risks or challenges. Success blinds them to emerging threats.\n\nKey signs:\n- Rationalizing bad results instead of addressing the root causes.\n- Overconfidence in the organization’s ability to recover.\n- Downplaying external shifts, such as market changes or competitor innovations.\n\n4️⃣ Grasping for Salvation\n\nIn response to mounting problems, the organization takes desperate actions - often bold but unsustainable - in an attempt to quickly regain success.\n\nKey signs:\n- Focusing on quick fixes like flashy acquisitions or leadership overhauls.\n- Abandoning disciplined strategies in favor of risky moves.\n- Looking for a “silver bullet” solution rather than incremental progress.\n\n5️⃣ Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nThe organization either becomes irrelevant in its market or collapses entirely. At this stage, recovery is unlikely or impossible.\n\nKey signs:\n- Loss of talent and customers.\n- Bankruptcy, closure, or absorption by another company.\n- An irreversible loss of purpose or competitive edge.\n\nThe five stages are both intuitive and obvious, although remarkably hard to see when one’s in the beginning or the middle of a stage.\n\nHaving seen the five stages play out first hand while I was at #Nokia, I can personally testify to their accuracy. \n\nIt’s good to remember that decline is not inevitable or irreversible until the later stages. \n\nIf identified and addressed early (stages 1 - 3), organizations can take corrective action to regain their footing. \n\nLeadership discipline, humility, and a focus on core strengths are essential to recovery.\n\n”How the Mighty Fall” is a must-read for leaders who want to prevent organizational decline - or navigate their way out of it. \n\nThe message is clear: \n\nDecline is not inevitable if you remain disciplined, humble, and focused on your core purpose.",

        "text": "In today’s world of #disinformation, #polarisation, and #technological #change, the teachings of Hannah Arendt, a renowned 20th century political theorist, resonate more than ever. \n\nHer insights on power, democracy, and the human condition remind us of our shared responsibility in shaping a better future, for all, and not just a select few.\n\nHere are a few timeless lessons from Arendt:\n\n👉 The Banality of Evil\nArendt observed how ordinary people, through thoughtlessness and blind obedience, can perpetuate atrocities. \n\n“The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.” \n\n👉 The Fragility of Democracy\nIn ”The Origins of Totalitarianism”, Arendt warned of how democracies can decay when trust in institutions collapses and apathy takes hold. \n\n”Before mass leaders seize the power to fit reality to their lies, their propaganda is marked by its extreme contempt for facts as such, for in their opinion fact depends entirely on the power of man who can fabricate it.”\n\n👉 The Importance of Plurality\nArendt celebrated the richness of human diversity, writing that “human plurality, the basic condition of both action and speech, has the twofold character of equality and distinction. If men were not equal, they could neither understand each other, nor understand their predecessors, nor make plans for the future and foresee the needs of their successors.”\n\nIn a world divided by polarization, her teachings urge us to embrace diversity as a strength.\n\n👉 The Role of Truth in Politics\nArendt warned that when facts are undermined, public discourse becomes chaotic. \n\n“The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction…no longer exists.” \n\nHer words challenge us to defend truth in an age of disinformation.\n\n👉 The Need for Critical Thinking\nAbove all, Arendt believed that thoughtlessness is a dangerous state. \n\n”Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there. That is the banality of evil.” \n\nIn today’s fast-paced, algorithm-driven world, her call to “think what we are doing” reminds us to reflect deeply on our choices and their impact.\n\nArendt’s timeless ideas push us to engage meaningfully in our communities, safeguard democratic values, and remain vigilant against forces that threaten freedom and human dignity. \n\n#criticalthinking #democracy #HannahArendt #plurality #truth #facts #totalitarianism",

The Kinect added to that legacy by creating an entirely new way to play. \n\nIt’s incredible how #gaming can bring generations together, whether it’s revisiting classics or exploring the latest tech. \n\nFor me, the Kinect isn’t just about nostalgia - it’s about the timeless fun of playing together, controller-free. \n\nWhat are your favorite gaming memories, whether old or new? I’d love to hear about the consoles, games, or moments that have left a lasting impact on you and your family!",

        "text": "Early in my first engineering manager role, I had a 1:1 with a junior team member that left a lasting impression. He shared how overwhelmed he felt by the sheer number of acronyms our team used - myself included.\n\nSometimes, he’d stop and ask what an acronym stood for. Other times, he’d jot it down to ask later. But more often than not, he’d let it pass, unsure of its meaning, and wait for context to fill in the gaps.\n\nIt was a wake-up call. While we thought acronyms made us efficient - or perhaps made us sound more skilled - what they actually did was create a barrier for one of our team members to fully understand and contribute.\n\nThat day, I made a promise to myself: \n\nI’d always try to clarify acronyms if there was even the slightest chance someone in the room might not understand.\n\nSure, sometimes the explanation feels unnecessary. \n\nBut other times, a nod, a smile, or even just a look of relief tells me it was worth it. It’s a small act that goes a long way toward fostering inclusion and making everyone feel part of the conversation.\n\nAs Albert Einstein once said:\n\n“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”\n\nLanguage, like leadership, is meant to build bridges, not walls.\n\nHave you had a similar moment where someone’s feedback helped you grow as a leader?

        "text": "👉 How do you objectively assess the operational maturity of an infrastructure team?❓\n\nThere’s no single metric that perfectly reflects a team’s efficiency, reliability, and alignment with business objectives. \n\nHowever, several key metrics can provide strong indications of maturity. Some are well-known classics, while others are less common yet equally valuable:\n\n1️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Adoption\n\t•\tMeasures the proportion of infrastructure managed through code.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: Higher adoption ensures consistency, scalability, and reduced manual errors.\n\n2️⃣ Automated Testing Coverage\n\t•\tEvaluates how much of the infrastructure is tested automatically.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: Greater coverage catches issues early, leading to more reliable deployments.\n\n3️⃣ Deployment Frequency\n\t•\tTracks how often the team releases new updates or features.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: High frequency signals agility and streamlined processes.\n\n4️⃣ Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)\n\t•\tMeasures the average time to restore services after an incident.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: Lower MTTR reflects robust incident response and recovery mechanisms.\n\n5️⃣ Change Failure Rate\n\t•\tCalculates the percentage of changes that result in failures requiring remediation.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: A low rate reflects effective change management and deployment quality.\n\n6️⃣ Service Level Objectives (SLOs) Compliance\n\t•\tMonitors adherence to defined performance and reliability targets.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: Consistent compliance demonstrates strong service management practices.\n\n7️⃣ Incident Frequency and Severity\n\t•\tTracks the number and impact of incidents over time.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: A declining trend indicates improved stability and proactive issue management.\n\n8️⃣ Operational Documentation Quality\n\t•\tAssesses the comprehensiveness and accessibility of documentation.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: High-quality docs support efficient onboarding, troubleshooting, and scalability.\n\n9️⃣ On-Call Metrics\n\t•\tEvaluates the health and effectiveness of on-call practices, including response times and workload balance.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: Healthy on-call practices foster resilience and avoid burnout.\n\n🔟 Continuous Improvement Initiatives\n\t•\tMonitors the implementation of lessons learned from post-incident reviews and proactive process enhancements.\n\t•\tWhy it matters: A commitment to continuous improvement shows operational excellence.\n\n👉 Did I miss any important metrics, or do these provide a fairly comprehensive reflection of an infrastructure team’s operational maturity? Let me know your thoughts!",

        "text": "Good to Great: Lessons Beyond Business\n\nI recently finished Jim Collins’ classic Good to Great, and it struck me how its principles extend far beyond business - they apply to #life, #leadership, and #personalgrowth.\n\nThe book explores why some companies transition from mediocrity to excellence while others fail to sustain greatness. \n\nCollins distills this into actionable principles, many of which resonate on a deeply personal level:\n\n1. The #Hedgehog Concept\nGreat companies (and individuals) thrive at the intersection of three things: what they are deeply passionate about, what they can be the best at, and what drives their economic (or life) engine. This applies to personal purpose too - when we align our #skills, #passions, and #opportunities, we position ourselves for meaningful #growth.\n\n2. Level 5 Leadership\n#Humility combined with fierce #resolve defines great leaders. This principle isn’t just about leading companies - it’s about showing up in every aspect of life with a servant’s heart and a relentless commitment to #excellence.\n\n3. First Who, Then What\nCollins emphasizes getting the #rightpeople “on the bus” before deciding the #direction. In life, this means surrounding yourself with people who share your values and uplift you, whether professionally or personally.\n\n4. The #Flywheel Effect\nMomentum builds from #consistent, #disciplined #effort. Success isn’t about one big leap; it’s about pushing the flywheel forward, one disciplined turn at a time. This idea encourages #patience and #persistence in achieving goals.\n\n5. #Confront the Brutal #Facts\nGreatness requires an unflinching commitment to #reality. Whether in #relationships, #careers, or personal #goals, honesty about challenges is the foundation of growth.\n\nThe brilliance of ”Good to Great” lies in its simplicity and universality. \n\nIt’s a roadmap not only for building great companies but for leading a life of purpose, discipline, and impact.",
