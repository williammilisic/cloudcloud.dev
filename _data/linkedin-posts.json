        "text": "The argument that \"if we just stick to Kubernetes and avoid serverless, we won't be locked in\" is a common but fundamentally naive oversimplification of cloud vendor lock-in. \n\nThis perspective conflates platform portability with application portability, ignoring the true source of flexibility: your team's talent and your code's architecture.\n\nTo be blunt, if you have engineers capable of writing, rewriting, and adapting your code for new hosting environments at will, you are never truly locked in. \n\nYour flexibility is a function of your human capital and architectural choices. \n\nIf you lack this engineering capability, then your strategic problems run far deeper than a simple Kubernetes vs. serverless debate; you are already vulnerable, regardless of your infrastructure choice.\n\nLet's dissect the serverless lock-in myth. \n\nWhen you build a serverless architecture on a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions), you are, in most cases, deploying your code to a container-based runtime. \n\nThe key is that the cloud provider manages this container, its scaling, and its networking entirely for you. \n\nCrucially, the underlying code itself - your business logic - is often not inherently locked to that platform. \n\nWith careful abstraction, you can containerize that same logic and run it on Kubernetes. \n\nThe inverse - extracting a complex, stateful application deeply intertwined with Kubernetes APIs and custom operators to run on a pure serverless platform - is often far more difficult.\n\nThis leads to the critical cost-benefit analysis. \n\nThe promise of K8s is standardization and portability, but it comes at a steep price: a massive management overhead for the control plane, nodes, networking, storage, and ingress controllers. \n\nYou are effectively building and maintaining your own \"cloud\" within a cloud. \n\nServerless, by contrast, offloads this immense operational burden to the vendor, allowing your team to focus on delivering features.\n\nThe financial equation is stark: running a containerized application on a managed Kubernetes service (like EKS or GKE) can easily be an order of magnitude (10x) more expensive than its serverless equivalent for comparable workloads, primarily due to the cost of reserving always-on compute resources versus paying for precise, millisecond-level execution.\n\nIf you have the luxury of having workloads that fit the serverless model (event-driven, stateless, scalable) without functional drawbacks, you should consider yourself lucky. \n\nChoosing to forgo the immense benefits of serverless in favor of a more expensive, complex, and labor-intensive Kubernetes setup solely to avoid a mitigated form of lock-in is an irrational trade-off. \n\nTrue architectural maturity is about making strategic bets that maximize business value, not pursuing a purist - and often illusory - ideal of portability at any cost. \n\nThe most valuable portability is in your code and your team's skills, not in your choice of infra.\n\n#k8s #faas",

        "text": "Like many, I‚Äôve found this year to be an emotional rollercoaster, professionally and personally. \n\nThe constant barrage of conflicting narratives, twisted facts, and blatant misinformation can be intellectually draining and deeply concerning. \n\nIt was in this context that I picked up General Michael V. Hayden‚Äôs 2018 book, \"Assault on Intelligence: American National Security in an Age of Lies.\"\n\nWhile written during the first half of the first Trump term, reading it now feels less like revisiting history and more like reading an urgent, clarifying memo about the present moment. \n\nHayden, former director of both the CIA and NSA, is no partisan bomb-thrower. \n\nHe is a career intelligence professional who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents. \n\nHis central thesis is as straightforward as it is alarming: the very concept of objective, knowable truth is under sustained attack, and this erosion is the single greatest threat to security and democratic integrity of the Western world.\n\nThe book masterfully outlines how the modern intelligence community works - its processes, its ethos of speaking truth to power, and its inherent uncertainties. \n\nHayden then contrasts this world of evidenced-based analysis with what he terms the \"post-truth\" environment, where feelings often outweigh facts and where the authorities of institutions are deliberately undermined.\n\nMy takeaways:\n\n1. The Professional Value of Truth: \n\nHayden argues that truth isn't a political opinion; it's a professional necessity. \n\nIn our businesses, we rely on accurate data, rational market analysis, and reliable communication to make sound decisions. \n\nThis book is a powerful reminder of what happens when those foundations are intentionally weakened.\n\n2. Institutional Integrity Matters: \n\nThe assault Hayden describes isn't just on individuals, but on institutions themselves - the press, the courts, and the intelligence community. \n\nThis resonates deeply in the corporate world. \n\nOur companies rely on trust in their brand, their products, and their leadership. \n\nUndermining that trust has severe, long-term consequences.\n\nAssault on Intelligence is not a comfortable read, but it is a necessary one. \n\nIt is a compelling, expertly argued defense of reason and expertise from a man who has spent his life in the intelligence community. \n\nFor professionals navigating a world increasingly saturated with misinformation, Hayden‚Äôs book provides both a critical warning and a measured dose of long-term optimism.\n\nIt also reminded me that upholding a commitment to truth isn‚Äôt just a moral choice; it‚Äôs a professional imperative.\n\n#BookReview #NationalSecurity #Intelligence #MichaelHayden #Truth #PostTruth #Strategy #CriticalThinking",

        "text": "Vill du skicka bilder till n√•gon p√• internet? D√• m√•ste du f√∂rst godk√§nna att staten scannar bilden. I veckan l√§ckte uppgifter som visar att regeringen tycker att det √§r en bra id√©.\n\nI flera √•r har EU:s regeringar f√∂rs√∂kt enas om det som har kallats ‚ÄúChat control‚Äù. Nu har Arbetsgruppen under EU:s ministerr√•d tr√§ffats igen f√∂r att f√∂rs√∂ka n√§rma sig ett beslut om saken.\n\nDet handlar om ett f√∂rslag att g√∂ra det obligatoriskt f√∂r n√§tj√§ttar, i jakt p√• √∂vergreppsmaterial, att scanna igenom allt det anv√§ndarna skickar p√• n√§tet. √Ñven i privata chattkonversationer.\n\nHur det har kunnat passera under tystnad?\n\nF√∂r att brottet √§r barnporr. Ingen politiker vill protestera mot en s√•dan lag. Ingen vill framst√• som att de f√∂rsvarar pedofiler, √§ven om konsekvensen √§r att varje medborgare √§r skyldig tills motsatsen bevisas.\n\nSkapare av f√∂rslaget var svenska EU-kommission√§ren Ylva Johansson. Kritiker av f√∂rslaget ‚Äì vilket varit ovanligt unisont i allt fr√•n m√§nniskor√§ttsexperter, journalister och cybers√§kerhets akademiker ‚Äì menar att det skapar ett unikt intr√•ng i r√§tten till privata samtal. F√∂r enligt ursprungsf√∂rslaget ska ingenting f√• vara hemligt p√• internet. Den helstr√§ckskryptering som n√§tj√§ttarna genom √•ren lagt miljarder p√• att utveckla ‚Äì s√• att de sj√§lva aldrig ska kunna l√§sa sina anv√§ndares privata konversationer ‚Äì skulle brytas.\n\nMen det √§r tekniskt om√∂jligt. Hela id√©n med en s√•dan kryptering √§r att bara mottagare och avs√§ndare kan l√§sa vad som skickas. S√• i det senaste f√∂rslaget tror sig EU:s regeringar hittat ett kryph√•l: Medborgare ska f√∂rst tillfr√•gas om de till√•ter att staten tar en titt p√• bilden de √§r p√• v√§g att skicka, innan den g√•r iv√§g. Tackar de nej? Ja, de f√•r de heller inte anv√§nda internet f√∂r att skicka bilden.\n\nDet l√•ter dystopiskt?\n\nTja, Sveriges regering tycker det √§r en bra id√©. Det vet jag eftersom jag l√§st den instruktion regeringen skickat till den svenska grupp som sk√∂ter f√∂rhandlingen. Instruktionen l√§cktes till mig i veckan och jag har nu kunnat verifiera dess √§kthet.\n\nI instruktionen tydligg√∂rs att f√∂rslaget handlar om att ‚Äúsp√•rning‚Äù ska kunna ske ‚Äúinnan √∂verf√∂ringen av inneh√•ll och kr√§va anv√§ndarens medgivande‚Äù. Denna typ av ‚Äúfrivillighet‚Äù √§r ett n√§stan √§nnu st√∂rre intr√•ng √§n att f√∂rs√∂ka √∂vervaka alla bilder, eftersom det st√§ller ett ultimatum: √ñvervakas eller sluta anv√§nda internet. √Ñnd√• skriver regeringen i instruktionen att Sverige ser ‚Äúpositivt p√• att krypterade tj√§nster √•terigen omfattas‚Äù och det nya f√∂rslaget hanterar cybers√§kerhetsfr√•gorna p√• ‚Äúett godtagbart s√§tt‚Äù.\n\nMandatet till f√∂rhandlingen √§r prelimin√§rt eftersom ett godk√§nnande ytterst beh√∂ver f√∂rankras √§ven i riksdagen. Men riksdagen har redan gett sitt godk√§nnande till tidigare kompromissf√∂rslag som varit intr√§ngande p√• liknande s√§tt. D√• har det inte bara g√§llt bilder (vilket det senaste f√∂rslaget begr√§nsar sig till), utan √§ven text.\n\nOch st√∂det har varit brett, alla partier utom Centerpartiet och Sverigedemokraterna √§r positiva (l√§s mer i l√§nken)",

        "text": "There are probably a few things in the world as fun as sharing one‚Äôs favourite movies, music, games etc with one‚Äôs offspring. \n\nI‚Äôve been most lucky in getting my 12 year old son to embrace some of my loves for entertainment categories as diverse as Star Wars, James Bond, Simpsons and South Park. More recently we watched The Tron Legacy together.\n\nThis is truly one of the classics. The eternal fight between light and dark, acceptance and dominance, David and Goliath. \n\nIt also comes with many learnings and insights weaved together within all the digital action.\n\nBeyond the incredible visuals and soundtrack, the film sparked a fantastic conversation with my son about what happens when technology escapes human control, and what it means to be ‚Äùreal‚Äù and ‚Äùalive‚Äù. \n\nIt‚Äôs a story about a son stepping into the vast digital universe his father created, not to simply inherit it, but to understand it, challenge it, and ultimately redefine it on his own terms.\n\nIt struck me how much this mirrors our roles as leaders and mentors, whether in parenting or in business. \n\nWe aren't just passing down a static \"manual\" of what we know. \n\nWe're providing a framework, a \"Grid\" if you will, and then empowering the next generation to innovate, question, and improve upon it. \n\nOur goal and challenge is to create environments where they can find their own voice and write their own code.\n\nThe real magic isn't just in them embracing our old loves; it's in the new dialogues and shared understandings that emerge from them.\n\n#Parenting #Leadership #Legacy #Mentorship #TronLegacy #CompanyCulture",

What if this seemingly irrational choice is actually a genius move I'm missing?\"\n\nBut the truth is, what appears to be a bad strategic choice normally is just that: a bad strategic choice.\n\nThe best way to deal with that anxiety-inducing sales pitch is to see it for what it is: a live case study. \n\nLearn from someone else‚Äôs expensive mistakes as they happen. \n\nIt‚Äôs normally a much cheaper way to gain strategic clarity.\n\nThe strongest strategy is built on your own first principles, not on the fear of being left behind.\n\n#Strategy #Leadership #BusinessStrategy #DecisionMaking #FOMO #Sales",

It‚Äôs the driver of our reward-seeking behaviour.\n- Break large goals into small, manageable tasks and celebrate completing each one.\n\nüòä Serotonin: The Mood Stabilizer\n- Regulating mood, feelings of well-being, happiness, and self-confidence. It gives you a sense of pride and significance.\n- Practice gratitude - reflect on your past achievements. Getting sunlight and spending time in nature are also powerful triggers.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è Oxytocin: The Love & Trust Hormone\n- Social bonding, building trust, deepening relationships, and reducing stress. It‚Äôs the foundation for human connection.\n- Give someone a genuine compliment, hug a loved one, or practice acts of kindness.\n\nüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Endorphins: The Pain-Killing Chemical\n- Stress relief, pain suppression, and generating feelings of euphoria (the \"runner's high\"). It‚Äôs the body‚Äôs natural mask for pain.\n- Laughter is the easiest way. So is vigorous exercise.\n\nüí™ Testosterone: The Confidence Hormone\n- Building confidence, fostering a sense of strength and well-being, and increasing competitiveness (in both men and women).\n- Winning (even small wins), setting and achieving goals, and strength training.\n\nüßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cortisol: The Stress Chemical\n- This is the stress and alert hormone. In small, short bursts it's crucial for survival, but chronic high levels are harmful.\n- The key is to reduce and control it through meditation, deep breathing, laughter, and getting enough sleep.\n\nThe powerful lesson is that we are not passive victims of our brain chemistry. We have the agency to actively design our days and interactions to generate the positive substances naturally and manage the negative ones, leading to a more engaged, motivated, and fulfilling life.\n\n#personaldevelopment #selfleadership #hormones #highonlife",

Rarely carry a manager‚Äôs stress to my team. \n\nIf it leaks? Time-box it. Never normalize it.\n\nScience backs this up:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Stress is contagious (Harvard Business Review). Cortisol spikes cascade through teams.  \n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Chronic stress shrinks brain (Yale), killing focus & creativity.  \n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Psychological safety != pressure (Google‚Äôs Project Aristotle). Fear stifles growth.  \n\nHow I fight the cycle:\n\n‚úÖ Name it: Call out stress sources transparently.  \n\n‚úÖ Buffer up: Absorb pressure from above; filter demands.  \n\n‚úÖ Model recovery: Take breaks.

        "text": "Thank you for all your messages and let me assure that I hear and understand your worry regarding #ChatControl #CSAM Danish proposal. We must stop this. ‚ùóÔ∏è\n\nüëâ The Danish EU Presidency is pushing a new, even more radical and unbelievable, version of the so called Chat Control #CSAM proposal. The vote is now scheduled for October 14. \n\nIf the Hungarian proposal was bad, the Danish version is even more extreme pushing for a creation of an Orwellian world.\n\n üëâ It includes the mandatory mass scanning of private communications and aims to break secure encryption by forcing client-side scanning into the private messaging apps. ‚ÄºÔ∏è\n\n‚òùÔ∏è The proposal as it stands now would force companies to scan for, not only known but also, \"unknown\" material using experimental and unreliable AI.\n\n‚òùÔ∏è The government and military accounts will be exempt from this intrusive and unreliable scanning. Sounds like an authoritarian leader's dream. üò£\n\nThis poses a massive risk of exposing our private communications and photos. Also non-transparent AI would make decisions about leaking your personal conversations and private photos.\n\nThis plan violates blatantly our fundamental rights due to accessing the content of private citizens. This will also create better access to criminals to our messaging services and achieve nothing to protect our children - the opposite.‚ùóÔ∏è\n\nüëâ The next critical meeting is on September 12. Governments will be finalizing their positions by then. We must now ensure all countries and our citizens understand what this proposal stands for. ‚òùÔ∏è This would violate our privacy and not protect any children. \n\nThe European Parliament must also stand against mass scanning and breaking encryption. ‚ùóÔ∏è\n\n#privacy\n#CSA",

Pair Essential with Enjoyable\n\n‚ÄúThe effortless state is incompatible with resentment. Make the essential things easy by making them enjoyable.‚Äù \n\n‚Üí Mix essential tasks with joy. Brainstorm on walks. Listen to podcasts while doing admin. Listen to your favourite music while housecleaning. Combine whatever makes it lighter and easier to finish up your ‚Äúchores‚Äù.\n\n2. Start with \"Minimum Viable Action\"\n\n‚ÄúA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.‚Äù - Lao Tzu\n\n‚Üí Ask: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the tiniest step I can take right now?‚Äù Open the doc. Draft one sentence. Progress ‚â† perfection.\n\n3. Timebox to Prevent Overcomplication\n\n\"Complexity is procrastination in disguise.\"\n\n‚Üí Set boundaries for any effort. Set a lower and an upper time limit for any task big or small. Constraints create clarity and conserve energy.\n\n4. Build \"Done for Tomorrow\" Systems\n\n\"Do it once to benefit forever.‚Äù\n\n‚Üí Automate, create templates, systematize. Document processes. Batch similar tasks. Invest minutes today to save hours tomorrow.\n\nIn the modern workplace, ‚ÄúEffortless‚Äù is your toolkit for impact without exhaustion. \n\nLess friction = more flow.  \n\n‚Üí My takeaways:\n\n- Deliberately timeboxing work \n- Starting tasks I‚Äôd rather avoid with micro-actions \n\n#Effortless #Productivity #TimeManagement #Focus #GregMcKeown #WorkSmart #Timeboxing #SelfLeadership",

No guilt, no FOMO. Just quiet appreciation for the pause.  \n\nWas it age? Hard-bought experience? \n\nProbably both. And honestly? It felt like growth.\n\nI still rode every slide (yes, even the \"oh-god-why\" ones, once!). \n\nBut watching my kids fly ahead while I caught my breath, I realized: \n\nKnowing your limits isn‚Äôt weakness; it‚Äôs clarity.\n\nI was proud to keep pace most of the time - and even prouder watching seniors tackle those same slides with grit and grins.  \n\nAs Teddy Roosevelt once said: \n\n\"Comparison is the thief of joy.\"\n\nYesterday wasn‚Äôt about keeping up. \n\nIt was about showing up - for the laughs, the shared moments, and the humility to step back when needed. And that, to me, is the real adventure.  \n\nTakeaway:\n\nEnergy fades. \n\nCourage evolves. \n\nBut curiosity? That‚Äôs ageless. \n\nHere‚Äôs to embracing the ride - on your terms!\n\n#Parenting #LifeLong #Adventure #GrowthMindset",

Here, my father dazzled with dives my sister and I desperately tried to copy.\n\nReturning yesterday, with my wife, kids, and parents beside me, unlocked a flood of positive memories. \n\nThe place felt timeless: the parking lot, the grass-covered slopes, the red sand, and the Fyris√•n's familiar murkiness ‚Äì all unchanged. \n\nWe arrived early, finding space before the sun drew crowds. Swimming with my son, I was instantly transported.\n\nAs if by magic, my 45 years dissolved. I was 14 again.\n\nSwimming upstream, then down, just as I used to. Memories surged back: a childhood woven with equal parts difficulties, opportunities, love, sadness, and topped off with hard work, and fierce determination to forge ahead.\n\nThat swim wasn't just exercise; it was a conversation with my younger self. And the most profound moment? \n\nSeeing my son catch up, then racing him back to shore. \n\nPride washed over me ‚Äì not just in him, but in the enduring legacy of simple places and shared experiences.\n\n‚ÄúWe do not remember days, we remember moments.‚Äù ‚Äì Cesare Pavese\n\nThe Takeaway:\n\nReconnecting with our roots, especially the humble ones that shaped us, is powerful. It reminds us where resilience, joy, and core values were forged. \n\nSharing those places with the next generation? \n\nThat‚Äôs where the past truly comes alive ‚Äì and where we see how far we‚Äôve swum. üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n#Nostalgia #Family #Resilience #PersonalGrowth #Swimming #Uppsala #Memories #Roots #Legacy\n\nP.S. 1st image: me and my sister back in the 90s in the Storvadsbadet parking lot, 2nd image: me and my son yesterday in roughly the same spot, 3rd image: an image of Storvadsbadet from yesterday.",

Air miles piled up; my health did not.  \n\nThen came the catalyst: marriage and children. \n\nI asked myself: What kind of father did I want to be? One struggling to keep up? Or one matching my kids‚Äô energy? I chose the latter.  \n\nBut resolve didn‚Äôt make it easy. \n\nStarting was brutal. \n\nI was the awkward newcomer in the gym, fumbling while everyone else seemed ‚Äúborn there.‚Äù I felt out of place, but I persisted.  \n\n\"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\" -  Aristotle\n\nAnd slowly, the habits stuck. I began with 2-3 days a week, honoring the routine. The more I ran and trained, the easier it became. \n\nResults compounded. As progress showed - a faster mile, heavier weights, more energy - my motivation snowballed.  \n\nToday? I run nearly daily and hit the gym 2-3 times weekly. \n\nI‚Äôm now the guy who looks like he was ‚Äúborn there‚Äù to the new person fiddling with equipment. And yes - I still (mostly!) outpace my teenagers üòâ.  \n\nWhy share this?  \n\nBecause transformation is possible for anyone. \n\nI went from sedentary smoker to dedicated athlete in my 30s. \n\nNot through genetics or luck, but consistency and willpower.  \n\n\"Small habits don‚Äôt add up. They compound.\" - James Clear\n\nYour \"before\" doesn‚Äôt define your \"after.\" \n\nWhether it‚Äôs fitness, career shifts, or personal growth - change begins when you decide your \"why\" is stronger than your comfort zone.\n\nHere‚Äôs to embracing the awkward beginnings, trusting the process, and proving that reinvention isn‚Äôt just possible - it‚Äôs life changing.  \n\n#GrowthMindset #Transformation #FitnessJourney #Resilience #PersonalDevelopment #Fatherhood #Consistency #LinkedInMotivation\n\nP.S.

        "text": "\"Your calendar is full again? No worries, you can do the actual work tonight.\"  \n\nSound familiar? This mantra of modern work culture isn‚Äôt a badge of honor - it‚Äôs a recipe for burnout and stagnation. üö®\n\nWorking now in the middle of Swedish ‚Äùindustrial vacation‚Äù, makes me reflect how packed my calendar normally is and why the current pace and room for reflection can‚Äôt be normal modus operandi? \n\nThe Paradox:\nSome stress about having \"air\" in our calendars, yet glorify back-to-back meetings. \n\nSome call days \"for collaboration\" and nights \"for execution.\" \n\nBut if every minute is spoken for - whether you‚Äôre a CEO or a developer - when does the actual thinking happen?\n\nLet‚Äôs break this down with science:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£  Reflection & Deep Work:\n‚ÄùWhen do you get time to reflect on the work you‚Äôre assigned?\"\n\nCognitive science shows that reflection consolidates learning and improves decision-making (Harvard Business Review). \n\nConstant context-switching between meetings shatters focus, leaving no space for synthesis. \n\nCal Newport‚Äôs research on \"Deep Work\" proves that uninterrupted blocks are non-negotiable for high-value output.  \n\n2Ô∏è‚É£  Improvement & Efficiency:\n\"When do you identify improvements to make work better?\"\n\nContinuous improvement requires deliberate pause. \n\nAs Peter Drucker said, \"Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.\"\n\nWithout white space, we default to autopilot - repeating inefficiencies simply because there‚Äôs no time to question them.  \n\n3Ô∏è‚É£  Creativity & Innovation:\n‚ÄùWhen do you make mind-leaps for breakthrough solutions?\"\n\nInsight doesn‚Äôt strike in a Teams call. \n\nNeuroscience reveals that ‚Äùaha!\" moments often arise during downtime (Default Mode Network research). \n\nArchimedes had his bathtub; you need calendar margins. Forcing \"out-of-the-box\" thinking in a boxed-in schedule is futile.  \n\nThe Hard Truth:\nA packed calendar isn‚Äôt productivity - it‚Äôs performative busyness. \n\nMeetings are tools, not the work itself.\n\nIf your role requires strategy, creation, or problem-solving (hint: most do), empty space isn‚Äôt luxury; it‚Äôs infrastructure.  \n\nThe Fix?\nüîπ Ruthlessly defend focus blocks (even 60 mins!).  \nüîπ Normalize declining meeting with unclear agendas & outcomes.  \nüîπ Measure output, not occupancy.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nAs Jason Fried (Basecamp) puts it: ‚ÄùWork doesn‚Äôt happen at work. Meetings, interruptions, and distractions do.‚Äù\n\nIf we want better solutions, happier teams, and sustainable performance - we must reclaim the space to think.  \n\nYour move: How will you carve out \"air time\" this week?  \n\n#Productivity #DeepWork #TimeManagement #Leadership #Innovation #WorkCulture #MentalHealth #Focus",

        "text": "Recently returned from an amazing week in Mallorca ‚Äì Spain never disappoints, and we‚Äôll be back soon! ‚òÄÔ∏è \n\nBut one experience at Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI) - operated by Aena, left us stressed and frustrated, highlighting a clear opportunity for improvement.  \n\nThe Issue:\n\nOn departure day, we arrived early, only to find no automated check-in or baggage drop counters. \n\nAll passengers were funneled into manual check-in lines. \n\nDespite 5 counters eventually opening, inefficiencies compounded:  \n\n- Staff handled complex items (e.g., a sword!) by involving multiple counters, halting the entire queue.  \n\n- Basic check-in (confirming passengers, printing boarding passes and luggage tags) took >5 minutes per group ‚Äì a task that takes <5 min on automated counters such as those at Arlanda. \n\n- After a 1+ hour queue, and then security (thankfully smooth) left us sprinting to the gate during final boarding.  \n\nThe Cost:\n\nThis inefficiency didn‚Äôt just stress passengers ‚Äì it cost the airport revenue.\n\nWe had zero time to shop, dine, or relax. \n\nMultiply that by hundreds of passengers daily, and the lost opportunity is significant.  \n\nThe Solution?\n\n- Automate routine tasks:\nSelf-service kiosks + baggage drops for standard check-ins free up staff.  \n\n- Dedicated counters:\nHandle special items/complex cases separately without disrupting flow.  \n\n- Training:\nEmpower staff to resolve issues swiftly without gridlocking operations.  \n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nEfficiency isn‚Äôt just about convenience ‚Äì it‚Äôs economic. \n\nWhen airports streamline processes:  \n\n‚úÖ Passengers spend more on retail/food.  \n\n‚úÖ Stress drops, improving brand loyalty.  \n\n‚úÖ Airlines face fewer delays.  \n\nInvesting in modern systems and automation pays for itself. \n\nPalma, we love you ‚Äì but let‚Äôs make the farewell as warm as the welcome! ‚úàÔ∏è  \n\n#TravelTech #Automation #AirportExperience #CustomerExperience #Aviation #Innovation #Mallorca #Travel",

But one take truly surprised me.  \n\nDuring a Swedish radio segment, rather than diving straight into whether Liam and Noel would survive the tour without parting ways for another 16 years, the hosts started by explaining who Oasis even were - and what they meant for Britpop and modern music.  \n\nI‚Äôll admit: it left me startled and shaken. \n\nIn my mind, their legacy felt like common knowledge - the anthems that defined a generation, the swagger that redefined rock. \n\nBut 16 years out of the spotlight? \n\nApparently, even giants fade from view.  \n\nAs the tour begins, I‚Äôm left reflecting on how quickly cultural memory shifts. \n\nWe once shouted ‚ÄùTonight, I‚Äôm a rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll star!‚Äù at bars; now, a new audience hears ‚ÄùSupersonic‚Äù live for the first time.  \n\nTo the Gallaghers: I hope you keep it together. Not just for the nostalgia, but because your music deserves new ears. \n\nThe world needs anthems that make crowds sway like ‚ÄùChampagne Supernova,‚Äù lyrics that capture restless ambition like ‚ÄúI need some time in the sunshine.‚Äù üåÖ  \n\nHere‚Äôs to hoping they don‚Äôt look back in anger - and that this reunion proves some things do live forever. üé∂  \n\n#Oasis #Britpop #ComebackTour #Nostalgia #Gallaghers #RockMusic\n\nP.S.

        "text": "I‚Äôm a longtime Jim Collins fan (‚ÄùGood to Great‚Äù and ‚ÄùBuilt to Last‚Äù are true classics!). \n\nAnother of his classics, now updated, ‚ÄùBeyond Entrepreneurship 2.0‚Äù delivers the deep research, actionable frameworks, and inspirational tone one would expect. \n\nThat said, much of the core material felt like a refinement of his established principles rather than groundbreaking new territory. \n\nIf you‚Äôre deeply familiar with his work, some sections will feel repetitive.  \n\nHowever, the power of Collins lies in timeless truths, not novelty.\n\nHere are my key takeaways:  \n\n1. Level 5 Leadership is Non-Negotiable:\nThe pinnacle of leadership combines fierce resolve with profound humility. \n\nLevel 5 leaders build greatness through others, not for themselves.  \n\n‚ÄùLevel 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company.\"\n\n2. The \"BHAG\" (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) is Your North Star:\nA clear, daring, long-term goal galvanizes the entire organization beyond incrementalism. It‚Äôs not just strategy; it‚Äôs a unifying cause.\n\n\"A BHAG is clear and compelling, serves as a unifying focal point of effort, and acts as a clear catalyst for team spirit.‚Äù\n\n3. Culture > Strategy (The \"Smell of the Place\"):\nYour culture isn't posters on a wall; it‚Äôs the lived behaviors and values reinforced daily. Great cultures attract and retain exceptional people who thrive.  \n\n‚ÄùCulture is not just about having fun. It‚Äôs about disciplined people engaging in disciplined thought and taking disciplined action.\"\n\n4. The Genius of the \"AND\":\nReject false trade-offs. Truly great companies pursue seemingly contradictory goals simultaneously (e.g., stability AND innovation, purpose AND profit, freedom AND responsibility). \n\n\"Embrace both extremes... not as forces to balance, but as forces to harness.\"\n\n5. Clock Building, Not Time Telling:\nFocus relentlessly on building a system (the \"clock\") that generates great results long after any single leader or hit product is gone. Build for endurance.  \n\n\"Build an organization that can endure and adapt, rather than just riding on a single great idea or charismatic leader.\"\n\n6. The 20 Mile March:\nConsistent, disciplined progress - achieving ambitious but predictable goals year after year - builds resilience and outperforms erratic bursts of effort.  \n\n\"Sustainable performance requires consistency through good times and bad.\"  \n\nWhile Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0 might not surprise Collins veterans, it remains an exceptionally valuable blueprint for leaders at any stage. \n\nIts strength lies in distilling decades of research into practical principles for building visionary, values-driven, and resilient companies. \n\nIf you're new to Collins, this is a phenomenal starting point. \n\nIf you're a seasoned reader, it‚Äôs a powerful refresher and refinement of enduring truths.  \n\n#JimCollins #BeyondEntrepreneurship #Leadership #CompanyCulture #BusinessStrategy #BookReview #BHAG",

Hohpe cuts through the noise with laser focus. \n\nThis book is an eye-opener, firmly grounded in first principles and centered on asking the crucial questions rather than blindly prescribing this or that framework. \n\nThe author expertly peels back the layers underneath the buzzwords and hype cycles that so often derail cloud initiatives. \n\nHe reminds us that successful cloud adoption is fundamentally a strategic, organisational, and leadership challenge ‚Äì far more than just some technical problems to be solved. \n\nIf you feel your cloud strategy or migration is drifting, hitting roadblocks, or lacking clear direction, investing in a few copies of this book and starting a book circle might be the wisest course of action.\n\nAfter reading Hohpe's clear, principled, and decision-focused guidance, you'll know better how to cut through the confusion and concentrate on the key priorities and choices that lead to real success. \n\nAfter all, it‚Äôs not just about going to the cloud; it‚Äôs about succeeding once you're there by making the right decisions along the way.\n\n#CloudStrategy #CloudMigration #DigitalTransformation #Leadership #ITStrategy #BookReview #GregorHohpe #TechLeadership #DecisionMaking #CloudComputing",

On-prem can‚Äôt match their elastic capacity for burst workloads.  \n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware: Clouds use custom-designed infrastructure; on-prem relies on off-the-shelf gear.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Diversity: Corporate data centers are often \"kitchen sinks\" of legacy tech; clouds are homogeneous and standardized.  \n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Bandwidth: Hyperscalers sit on internet backbones and lay thousands of kilometres of subsea fibre-optic cables; on-prem battles latency (20‚Äì30ms hops).  \n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Global Reach: Clouds deliver low-latency access worldwide; on-prem is typically region-locked.\n\nTo these five differences, one could add rate of innovation at CSPs due to both scale of operations (billions of users) and scale of both employed and associated talent (in hundreds of thousands and millions individuals), deep integration between various layers in the CSP service offering etc. \n\n‚ö†Ô∏è The Big Takeaway:\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to be fooled by surface similarities. \n\nHowever, on-prem and cloud operate in radically different contexts. \n\nAbstraction layers that ignore this often become costly illusions. \n\nMassive thanks to our curious trainees for sparking this reflection! üôå \n\nAttaching a screengrab from Gregor Hohpe‚Äôs brilliant book for detail.  \n\n#CloudComputing #OnPremise #HybridCloud #SEB #TechLeadership #DigitalTransformation #CloudStrategy",

Choose clouds for their strengths and only place workloads that make both technical and business sense in each.\n\n2. Govern fiercely: No rogue team choices. Standardize where it matters (IAM, networking, compliance).  \n\n3. Invest in deep expertise: You can‚Äôt leverage a cloud‚Äôs full potential without understanding its DNA.  \n\n4. Accept reality: Some duplication is inevitable - optimize for outcomes, not theoretical portability.  \n\nüéØ The Bottom Line  \n\n‚ÄúCloud agnostic‚Äù often means ‚Äúcloud mediocre.‚Äù\n\nTrue multicloud success isn‚Äôt about forcing sameness - it‚Äôs about intentionally leveraging difference. \n\nMaster each cloud‚Äôs depth, align with business goals, and govern with rigor. \n\nOnly then do you reap real benefits.  \n\n#CloudStrategy #Multicloud #CloudComputing #TechLeadership #DigitalTransformation #CloudTransformation",

Essentialism conserves mental energy for critical decisions.  \n\n- The Paradox of Choice (Schwartz, 2004): More options increase anxiety and reduce satisfaction. Essentialism reduces clutter - mental and physical.  \n\n- Opportunity Cost (Economics 101): Saying \"yes\" to one thing always means saying \"no\" to another. Essentialism forces honest trade-off evaluations.  \n\nIt‚Äôs important to remember that non-essential tasks aren‚Äôt harmless - they actively steal resources from game-changing work.\n\nAs McKeown writes: \"The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default.\"\n\nIf you‚Äôre overwhelmed, feel busy but unfulfilled, or struggle with boundaries, this book offers actionable clarity. \n\nIt‚Äôs not about doing less arbitrarily - it‚Äôs about making \"yes\" monumental by mastering \"no.\"\n\nEssentialism is not about how to get more things done; it‚Äôs about how to get the right things done. \n\n#Essentialism #Productivity #Focus #WorkLifeBalance #Leadership #BookReview",

        "text": "I had a great time yesterday presenting at the #googlecloudsummitnordics together with Gergely Szil√°gyi about our cloud journey at SEB, and how we are supporting thousands of developers with thousands of #GCP projects, through some automation magic and some amazing DevOps chops. \n\nTruth to be told, I don't enjoy the spotlight as much as one could think, but I am not afraid either when it's a topic I care about.\n\nFunny enough, although I spend some thoughts on what to say, when I stand there on stage, at least half of it remains unsaid. \n\nJust for fun, here is what I was thinking of saying on my 2 slides. \n\nSlide 1: \n\n\"The slogan for our tech organisation ‚ÄùHead in the cloud, feet on the ground‚Äù is telling for both where we are heading, where we are as well as how we reason about technology. \n\nWe employ 3000 engineers working in all possible tech stacks, from Cobol on mainframe to Golang on Knative. \n\nTechnology has been a natural part of our DNA since start almost 170 years ago and cloud transformation is no different. \n\nSEB‚Äôs cloud journey started back in 2019 with some initial exploration but got really serious when we signed our agreement with Google in 2021. \n\nIt hasn‚Äôt always been a straight road, there have been bumps on the way, but we have kept the course steady forward. \n\nOur initial setup was heavily oriented towards the full stack developers, or if you want early adopters in Geoffrey Moore's technology adoption curve. \n\nWe made sure there were guardrails, controls etc while still leaving development teams to fully manage, develop and operate their piece of our cloud. \n\nOver time however as more and more teams came into cloud we realized that full stack developers that want to code Java in the morning, have JavaScript for lunch and plan Terraform for dinner, are as rare as unicorns, so we began adding more and more platform engineering layers to fully support all our development teams needs. \n\nWe‚Äôve been on this journey for a few years now and our adoption numbers among our developer community are telling the story better than anything, while we also see that our engagement numbers have been consistently increasing over time.\"\n\nFor slide 2 notes, see Comments. \n\nFor how the talk actually turned out, watch the on-demand video available on Google Cloud Summit Nordics page. Video in comments. Registration required.\n\nI want to extend a thank you to Google Cloud for showcasing our story, to the audience that seemed interested and engaged throughout and to my partner on stage Gergely Szil√°gyi for great discussions and many laughs while preparing our presentation!\n\n#SEBTech #SEBCloud #LifeatSEB",

        "text": "Just wrapped up another excellent Google Cloud Summit Nordics! Here are my top \"aha\" moments:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£  Lift & Shift is Still Lift & Shi*t\n\nThe message was clear: ask any successful cloud migration what strategy they started with, and they'll confirm that going cloud makes sense only if you plan to use the cloud as intended ‚Äì cloud-native. Trying to replicate on-premise setups directly is still missing the point. See excellent presentations by Terveystalo and Mouseflow.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£  Digital Sovereignty: Pieces Falling In Place, But Gaps Remain\n    \nAll major cloud providers are talking data boundaries, local partnerships, and even bringing some key cloud capabilities back on-premise. While many building blocks are there, key pieces are still missing. Significant progress beyond the current level will likely require additional EU laws and regulations. The intent is visible, but the full solution isn't quite baked yet.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£  AI: Impressive, Contextual... But Where's the Groundbreaking?\n\nThe agentic and AI use cases showcased were undeniably impressive, especially regarding contextual reasoning and \"intelligence.\" However, I'm yet to see that truly revolutionary, jaw-dropping use case. Maybe that's just where we are right now? Or perhaps AI has become so seamlessly integrated and \"at home\" that our expectations have skyrocketed, making it harder to be as impressed as we were a few years ago. Solid progress, but the true paradigm shift feels... pending.\n\nOverall: A really well-organized event (as usual from Google Cloud!). \n\nMaybe the best part? Catching up with old colleagues I hadn't seen in years ‚Äì priceless. \n\nBig thanks to Google for hosting these invaluable gatherings!\n\nP.S. Stay tuned tomorrow for some thoughts on the lightning talk presentation I held together with Gergely Szil√°gyi.\n\n#GoogleCloud #CloudSummit #Nordics #CloudMigration #CloudNative #DigitalSovereignty #AI #GenerativeAI #TechEvent #SEBcloud #SEBtech #lifeatSEB",

This is where we normally live. \n\nBut the magic? That's Kairos (Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅœåœÇ):  \n\n‚è≥ The opportune moment.\n\nüö™ The open door, the gut-feeling \"YES,\" the perfect pivot.  \n\nüí° Inspiration striking, deep connection, flow state unlocked.  \n\nQualitative, ripe, divine timing. We yearn for this.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS: \n\nüîπ Kronos overload burns us out (always \"on,\" never \"done\").  \n\nüîπ Kairos blindness makes us miss gold (distracted, head down).  \n\nHACK YOUR TIME:\n\n1. Protect Kronos ruthlessly: Batch tasks, mute notifications, say \"no.\" ‚è±Ô∏èüîí  \n\n2. Create space for Kairos: Wander, wonder, disconnect. Be present. üå±‚ú®  \n\n3. Recognize the Kairos whisper: That urge to call someone you just thought of? Start with a new habit? DO IT. üöÄ  \n\nKronos runs the clock. \n\nBut Kairos changes the game.\n\nStop just managing time.  \n\nStart seizing moments.  \n\nAmong my most memorable Kairos moments were the births of my two children. When I afterwards was holding them in my arms, time stood still. \n\nWhat are your most memorable Kairos moments?\n\n#TimeManagement #Mindfulness #Productivity #Leadership #PersonalDevelopment #Kairos #Kronos #DeepWork #Innovation #WorkLifeBalance",

        "text": "From IaC to Machine-Building Machines: The Next Evolution in Cloud Engineering\n\nWhen we talk about Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the benefits are undeniable: versioned setups, minimized drift, and full control over cloud environments. \n\nBut here‚Äôs the catch - scaling IaC to thousands of cloud environments is where the real challenge begins.  \n\nManaging consistency, enforcing standards, and preventing sprawl across a sea of environments isn‚Äôt just about writing Terraform modules or CloudFormation templates anymore. \n\nIt demands something far more systemic: a Landing Zone Vending Machine.\n\nü§ñ What is then a Landing Zone Vending Machine?  \n\nImagine a system that:  \n\n1. Orchestrates all cloud environments toward a baseline configuration (your \"landing zone\").  \n\n2. Generates IaC code on-demand for creation, updates, and maintenance.  \n\n3. Validates inputs, handles errors gracefully, and ensures compliance before deployment.  \n\nIn short, it‚Äôs a machine that builds machines.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just infrastructure automation - it‚Äôs software development applied to infrastructure itself. \n\nüëâ Why This Changes Everything for Cloud Engineers\n  \nTraditional IaC requires scripting skills. \n\nBuilding a vending machine demands software engineering rigor: \n\n- Designing systems to process user input ‚Üí generate code ‚Üí deploy infrastructure.  \n\n- Implementing validation, error handling, and state management at scale.  \n\n- Treating the vending machine itself as a product, with CI/CD, testing, and observability.  \n\nThis shift mirrors trends like Platform Engineering and Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), where infrastructure becomes a self-service, codified product.  \n\nüîç Real-World Parallels  \n\n- AWS Control Tower and Azure Landing Zones are managed solutions for multi-account governance - but custom vending machines take this further, tailoring IaC generation to org-specific needs.  \n\n- Companies like Spotify and Netflix pioneered similar concepts for microservices orchestration, treating infrastructure as a consumable API.  \n\n- Hashicorp‚Äôs Sentinel or OpenPolicyAgent  (OPA) show how policy-as-code integrates into such systems to enforce guardrails.  \n\nüí°The Bottom Line  \n\nCloud engineers are evolving into cloud product developers. The future isn‚Äôt just writing IaC - it‚Äôs building systems that write IaC for you, at scale.  \n\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Are you ready to shift from scripting infrastructure to engineering the machines that build it?\n\n#IaC #CloudEngineering #LandingZone #CloudFoundation #DevOps #PlatformEngineering #Innovation",

        "text": "In recent conversations with Russians living in Sweden, I‚Äôve encountered a recurring argument: that rising European reservations toward Russia are rooted in well rooted ‚ÄúRussophobia.‚Äù \n\nWhile I respect the perspective, this narrative feels deeply incomplete. \n\nIt sidesteps critical context and ignores the legitimate concerns of nations that have lived in Russia‚Äôs shadow for centuries. \n\nLet‚Äôs speak plainly.  \n\nRussia is the world‚Äôs largest country, spanning 11 time zones, with a history marked by territorial expansion and domination of its neighbors. \n\nFrom the Tsarist era to the Soviet Union, its geopolitical playbook has long prioritized influence and control. \n\nUnder Putin, this pattern has not faded - it has intensified. \n\nThe annexation of Crimea, the war in Ukraine, cyberattacks, election interference, and the persistent rhetoric of reclaiming a ‚Äúsphere of influence‚Äù are not figments of a prejudiced imagination. \n\nThey are documented actions that understandably unsettle nations valuing sovereignty and self-determination.  \n\nTo our Russian friends: \n\nEurope‚Äôs wariness is not born of hatred or envy. We admire your nation‚Äôs staggering cultural contributions - Dostoevsky‚Äôs existential depth, Tolstoy‚Äôs moral grandeur, Shostakovich‚Äôs haunting symphonies, and the scientific brilliance of minds like Mendeleev. \n\nWe have no claim to your land, resources, or wealth. All we ask is reciprocity.  \n\nYour closest neighbors - Ukraine, Georgia, the Baltic states, Moldova - have made their choice. They seek integration with Europe not out of malice toward Russia, but out of a desire for stability, democracy, and the freedom to chart their own futures. \n\nImagine the goodwill that could follow if Russia chose to champion diplomacy over coercion, collaboration over intimidation. \n\nEurope is not your enemy. We are neighbors, and neighbors deserve mutual respect.  \n\nThis is not about Russophobia. \n\nIt is about accountability. Nations that have endured centuries of domination - or decades of Soviet occupation - have every right to defend their independence. \n\nEurope‚Äôs stance is not an attack on Russian identity; it is a defense of the principles that keep peace on our continent.  \n\nTo my Russian friends: \n\nWe see your humanity, your creativity, your resilience. We do not conflate politics with people. But we cannot ignore the actions of a government that invades neighbors, suppresses dissent, and weaponizes disinformation. The path to trust begins with acknowledging these realities.  \n\nLet us move forward with clarity. \n\nEurope seeks no empire. \n\nWe ask only that Russia, too, steps back from the rhetoric of empire. The world has changed. It‚Äôs time to embrace a future where security is not zero-sum, where influence is earned through partnership, not force.  \n\nAs Dostoevsky wrote, ‚ÄúThe mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.‚Äù \n\nLet that ‚Äúsomething‚Äù be peace.\n\n#russia #europe #ukraine #war #peace",

        "text": "üöÄ Why Your 3-Year Product Roadmap is a Fantasy (And What to Do Instead)\n\nLet me tell you a story. \n\nEarly in my PM career, I spent weeks crafting a beautiful 3-year roadmap. \n\nIt had swimlanes, milestones, and outcomes mapped to the quarter. \n\nI presented it with pride. \n\nFast forward 6 months: priorities shifted, stakeholders pivoted, and market dynamics flipped. \n\nThat roadmap? \n\nA relic. \n\nA lesson learned: \n\nIn tech, rigidity is the enemy of progress.\n\nProduct management is messy. \n\nFor complex products with shifting dependencies, fluid markets, and ever-changing leadership priorities, expecting a crystal ball to plot exact timelines is laughable. \n\nWorse, it‚Äôs dangerous. \n\nCommit to dates too early, and you‚Äôll either burn out teams rushing to meet arbitrary deadlines or lose credibility when reality (inevitably) derails the plan.  \n\nSo here‚Äôs my antidote: Ditch the calendar. \n\nThink in time chunks - Now, Next, Later.\n\n- NOW: What‚Äôs in flight today? What‚Äôs critical for the next 30-60 days? Focus on execution, blockers, and immediate outcomes.  \n\n- NEXT: What‚Äôs likely in the next 3-6 months? High-confidence bets, validated by stakeholder alignment and user research. Keep it directional, not granular.  \n\n- LATER: The vision. The North Star that guides decisions. No dates, just principles. Example: ‚ÄúSeamless omni-channel experience‚Äù or ‚ÄúAI-supported personalization at scale.‚Äù  \n\nThe reality bite? \n\nStakeholders don‚Äôt need false certainty. They need clarity on why we‚Äôre building, not exactly when. \n\nA key stakeholder once told me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it takes 12 or 18 months - just show me we‚Äôre moving toward something that matters.‚Äù  \n\nSo, PMs: Stop rearranging Gantt charts. \n\nStart leading with vision, flexibility, and ruthless prioritization. \n\nYour team‚Äôs sanity (and your credibility) will thank you.  \n\n#ProductManagement #Agile #Leadership #Roadmapping*",

They Have a Prioritization Problem.\n\nMost companies aren‚Äôt drowning because they can‚Äôt coordinate. \n\nThey‚Äôre drowning because they‚Äôre too afraid to say no. \n\nInternal politics. \n\nFear of competitors. \n\nFOMO disguised as ‚Äúopportunity.‚Äù \n\nThe result? A chaotic sprawl of half-baked projects, overwhelmed teams, and a culture where everything is urgent but nothing is critical.  \n\nInstead of making hard choices, leaders default to hiring more ‚Äúcoordinators‚Äù to ‚Äúalign‚Äù the chaos. \n\nBut here‚Äôs the irony: \n\nMore coordinators = more meetings, more check-ins, more stress for already stressed-out teams. \n\nThe vicious cycle spins faster.  \n\nAs Greg McKeown wrote in Essentialism: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt prioritize your life, someone else will.‚Äù\n\nCompanies that fail to ruthlessly prioritize, surrender their strategy to the loudest voice in the room.  \n\nA Harvard Business Review study found that 94% of executives cite ‚Äúpoor prioritization‚Äù as the top barrier to strategic execution. \n\nNot lack of coordination. \n\nNot lack of talent. \n\nBut the inability to say NO.\n\nThe fix? \n\nStop hiring coordinators to paper over the problem. \n\nStart asking:  \n\n‚úÖ What can we STOP doing?\n\n‚úÖ What really moves the needle?\n\nClarity beats consensus.\n\nFocus beats frenzy.  \n\nYour teams aren‚Äôt stressed because they can‚Äôt coordinate. \n\nThey‚Äôre stressed because you‚Äôre asking them to do everything. \n\nBreak the cycle.  \n\nüî• Drop the ‚Äúmaybe later.‚Äù \n\nStart with ‚Äúno, for now..‚Äù\n\n#Leadership #Productivity #Strategy #BusinessGrowth #Essentialism #Priorities #coordination #meetings #reports #roadmaps #reporting",

        "text": "üöÄ Kubernetes & Cloud Agnosticism: Cutting Through the Hype\n\nA while back, a colleague argued that deploying a third-party Kubernetes distro across public clouds is the ultimate solution to avoid vendor lock-in. \n\nWhile I agree Kubernetes is the de facto multicloud API, I pushed back on the rest. Here‚Äôs why:  \n\nThe Hidden Costs of \"Agnostic\" Kubernetes\n\nRunning a third-party K8s distro atop a cloud provider‚Äôs infrastructure would create unnecessary complexity without solving any real-world problems.  \n\n- Costly Expertise: \nConfiguring and maintaining standalone K8s demands rare (and expensive) skills. The CNCF‚Äôs 2023 survey found that 68% of organizations cite lack of expertise as a top barrier to Kubernetes adoption.\n\n- Lost Cloud-Native Benefits: \nBy sidestepping managed services (e.g., AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS), you forfeit built-in monitoring, logging, and security tools - forcing teams to rebuild these from scratch.  \n\n- Operational Overhead: \nGartner notes that 60% of multicloud teams struggle with inconsistent tooling, leading to fragmented workflows and slower incident response.  \n\nA Better Path: Own Your Code, Leverage the Cloud\n\nTrue portability isn‚Äôt about abstracting everything. \n\nIt‚Äôs about:  \n\n1. Owning Your Codebase: Ensure that you know the ins and outs of your applications including any dependencies.  \n\n2. Thin Kubernetes: Use cloud providers‚Äô managed K8s without unnecessary and quirky customizations. Treat it as a commodity layer.  \n\n3. Embrace Cloud Ops Expertise: Let cloud providers handle scaling, upgrades, and security patching. Focus on what your team does best.  \n\nAs Kelsey Hightower said, ‚ÄúKubernetes is a platform for building platforms. It‚Äôs not the final destination.‚Äù\n\nThe goal isn‚Äôt to reinvent the wheel but to build applications that can adapt to any cloud - without sacrificing efficiency.  \n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMulticloud agility comes from application design, not infrastructure gymnastics. \n\nBy keeping the cloud-specific glue to a minimum and maximizing code ownership, you retain flexibility and tap into the innovation (and budgets) of public clouds.  \n\nWhat about you? How are you balancing portability and practicality?\n\n#Kubernetes #CloudComputing #DevOps #Multicloud #TechStrategy",

        "text": "When I was twelve, I was evacuated from wartime Sarajevo alongside my wounded father, mother, and younger sister. \n\nThe events of that day are blurry in my memory, but one moment remains crystalline: a Canadian UN peacekeeper handing me a red maple leaf flag patch. \n\nAmid the uncertainty: Would we make it to the plane? Would my father get better? that small gesture became an anchor. \n\nI carried that patch for years, stitching it onto a summer jacket I eventually outgrew. But its symbolism never faded.  \n\nThat soldier likely saw a terrified child and offered what he had: a piece of his country‚Äôs identity. \n\nTo him, it might have been a simple act of kindness. \n\nTo me, it was a reminder that humanity persists even in darkness. \n\nCanada, to a war-scarred kid, became synonymous with compassion, dignity, and quiet strength.  \n\nToday, as headlines dissect tensions between Canada and the U.S., I feel a deep unease.\n\nThe absurd idea of Canada‚Äôs maple leaf ‚Äúabsorbed‚Äù into another flag isn‚Äôt just political rhetoric - it‚Äôs a erasure of what that symbol represents. \n\nA nation built on multiculturalism, peacekeeping, and stewardship of the land. \n\nA neighbor whose global reputation is defined not by dominance, but by generosity: sharing its flag, its values, and its open hand with the world.  \n\nLosing Canada‚Äôs distinct identity wouldn‚Äôt just diminish North America - it would impoverish the world. \n\nThe U.S. would lose more than a trading partner; it would lose a friend who embodies what it means to lead with humility. \n\nCanada‚Äôs maple leaf isn‚Äôt just fabric. It‚Äôs a promise - one that gave a child in a warzone hope, and still reminds us that some nations choose to build bridges, not walls.  \n\nTo my Canadian friends: Your flag flies far beyond your borders. Never underestimate its power. üåçüçÅ  \n\n#Canada #Peacekeeping #Gratitude #Leadership #InternationalRelations\n\n(Photo: Paul Lowe)",

        "text": "Yesterday morning, as I prepared to attend Women In Tech Stockholm, I felt an unexpected wave of nerves - more butterflies than I‚Äôve ever had before a conference. \n\nWhy? \n\nThe reasons piled up: Some colleagues (both male and female) had asked, ‚ÄùWhat will you do there?‚Äù My wife and daughter wondered the same. And then there was my own fear: ‚ÄùWould I feel out of place?‚Äù\n\nThe only unwavering support came from my 12-year-old son and our incredible SEB #witswe2025 team.  \n\nI went anyway.  \n\nWalking in, I was immediately greeted by former female colleagues whose warmth eased my anxiety. \n\nAs the day unfolded, I began to relax, connect, and feel at home. \n\nBut one reality lingered: \n\nOf 3,000 attendees, only a small fraction were men. \n\nFor me, this was a single day of being in the minority - a fleeting glimpse into an experience my female colleagues navigate every day in the tech industry, which is often dominated by men.  \n\nIt was profoundly humbling.\n\nThe discomfort of standing out, the subtle weight of being an ‚Äúoutsider,‚Äù the quiet effort to belong - these are not occasional challenges for women in tech. \n\nThey‚Äôre constants. \n\nThe conference wasn‚Äôt just a reminder of the gender gap; it was a mirror held up to my own biases and privileges.  \n\nI left with two convictions:  \n\n1. Empathy grows in unfamiliar soil.\nüëâ Stepping into spaces where we‚Äôre underrepresented reshapes perspective.  \n\n2. Allyship requires action.\nüëâ It‚Äôs not enough to acknowledge inequality; we must actively listen, learn, and amplify marginalized voices.  \n\nTo the men in tech: Seek out experiences where you‚Äôre the minority. Sit with the discomfort. Let it teach you. \n\nOnly then can we truly understand the change we need to drive - and become better allies in the process.  \n\nHuge thanks to the Women In Tech Stockholm team for creating this amazing space filled with incredible people, energising topics and awesome mingle!\n\n#WomenInTech #DiversityAndInclusion #Allyship #TechForGood #witswe2025 #SEBTech #sebcloud",

        "text": "üöÄ Application Modernization Isn‚Äôt Just About the Cloud ‚Äì Let‚Äôs Talk Code Ownership & Engineering Excellence!\n\nWe‚Äôve all heard the narrative: ‚ÄúMove to the cloud, and *poof* - your apps are modernized!‚Äù \n\nBut here‚Äôs the truth: the cloud is an enabler, not a magic wand. \n\nWhile it offers out-of-box simplicity, scalability and flexibility, modernizing applications starts long before you even think about hosting options. \n\nLet‚Äôs cut through the hype.  \n\nüõ†Ô∏è Modernization Begins with Code Ownership  \n\nYou can‚Äôt modernize what you don‚Äôt understand!\n\nDeep knowledge of your codebase - its dependencies, quirks, and technical debt - is non-negotiable.\n\nAs Martin Fowler puts it: \n\n‚ÄúRefactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.‚Äù\n\nWithout this mastery, teams risk compounding complexity, not reducing it. \n\nModernization demands ruthless prioritization: replacing obsolete libraries, decoupling monolithic architectures, and ensuring your app can run anywhere - whether on a Raspberry Pi, a VM, or the cloud.  \n\n‚öôÔ∏è Engineering Practices > Infrastructure Choices  \n\nCloud migration without foundational engineering rigor is like building a mansion on sand. \n\nThe real accelerators, for example?\n\n- 12-Factor App Principles (Heroku): Decouple from environments, enable portability.  \n\n- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Catch issues early, reduce fragility.  \n\n- CI/CD Pipelines: Automate, iterate, and deploy with confidence.  \n\nGene Kim nails it: ‚ÄùThe goal is to amplify feedback loops so that teams can continuously improve their systems - and themselves.‚Äù\n\nThese practices create systems that are resilient, adaptable, and truly cloud-ready, regardless of where they‚Äôre hosted.  \n\n‚òÅÔ∏è The Cloud Is Just the Icing, Not the Cake  \n\nYes, the cloud offers powerful and innovative tools: serverless, managed services, global scalability. \n\nBut starting with infrastructure-first thinking often backfires. \n\nGartner warns: \n\n‚ÄùThrough 2025, 70% of organizations that prioritize infrastructure modernization over application modernization will fail to meet their business goals.‚Äù\n\nRushing to the cloud without addressing code quality or architectural debt leads to soaring costs, vendor lock-in, and operational chaos. \n\nüîë The Takeaway? Modernize Upstream First  \n\n1. Own Your Code: Audit, document, and refactor relentlessly.  \n\n2. Embed Engineering Excellence: Adopt TDD, CI/CD, and modular design.  \n\n3. ONLY THEN Choose Your Platform: Cloud, hybrid, or on-prem - your app will thrive.  \n\nAs software legend Joel Spolsky once said: ‚ÄùAll legacy code is somebody else‚Äôs mess. Until it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù\n\nModernization isn‚Äôt a destination - it‚Äôs a mindset. Let‚Äôs build systems that outlast the next tech trend! \n\nüí¨ Your turn: How are you balancing code ownership and cloud strategy?\n\n#DevOps #CloudComputing #SoftwareEngineering #EngineeringExcellence #AppModernization #InfraModernization",

        "text": "We‚Äôre witnessing a high-stakes digital chicken race. \n\nWhile headlines fixate on tit-for-tat tariffs, Beijing is quietly executing a decadelong masterplan to achieve something far more strategic: tech independence.\n\nThe goal? Rewire the global supply chain so China‚Äôs digital future isn‚Äôt held hostage by foreign chips, software, or data rules.  \n\nHere‚Äôs how they‚Äôre doing it:  \n\nüá®üá≥ China‚Äôs Digital Sovereignty Blueprint\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Policy Muscle üí™ \n\n- ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù: Billions poured into semiconductors, AI, and 5G to break foreign monopolies.  \n\n- Data Localization Laws: Critical sectors like finance and energy must use domestic infrastructure and comply with strict cross-border data rules.  \n\n- Phase-Out Deadlines: Foreign software (e.g., Microsoft, Oracle) to be replaced in government systems by 2027.  \n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Homegrown Tech Ecosystems \n\n- Hardware: Loongson CPUs, SMIC chips, and Huawei‚Äôs HarmonyOS challenge Intel, TSMC, and Android. \n\n- Cloud & Software: Alibaba Cloud and Tencent now dominate Asia-Pacific markets, displacing AWS and Azure.  \n\n- Own Standards: BeiDou (China‚Äôs GPS alternative) and 5G patents aim to rewrite global tech rules.  \n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ The Big Sticking Points\n\n- Semiconductor Struggles: Despite state funding, China still imports 70% of high-end chips.

Why Letting Go May Be the Smartest Move! \n\nWe‚Äôve all been there - pouring time, money, and energy into a project, strategy, or relationship that‚Äôs clearly no longer working. \n\nThe Dakota Indians had a simple yet elegant solution for this: \n\n‚ÄúWhen you discover you‚Äôre riding a dead horse, dismount.‚Äù\n\nYet, modern organizations often double down with absurd ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù like buying a stronger whip, forming committees, or - my personal favorite - providing additional funding and/or training to increase the dead horse‚Äôs performance.  \n\nThe Dead Horse Theory isn‚Äôt just funny - it‚Äôs painfully accurate.\n\nThe metaphor exposes our tendency to cling to sunk costs. \n\nInstead of cutting losses, we:  \n\n- Throw resources at the problem. \n- Blame people.\n- Mask reality with jargon. \n\nWhy do we do this?\n\nFear of failure, bureaucratic inertia, or ego. \n\nBut the cost is steep: wasted time, demoralized teams, and stagnation. \n\nAs the list jokes, ‚Äùdeclaring that as the dead horse doesn‚Äôt have to be fed, it is less costly‚Äù doesn‚Äôt magically make it profitable - it just delays the inevitable.  \n\nDismounting takes courage however. \n\nHere‚Äôs how to do it: \n\n1. Acknowledge the horse is dead. Ask: ‚ÄúIf we started fresh, would we invest in this?‚Äù\n\n2. Reward agility, not stubbornness. Celebrate teams that pivot, not just those who ‚Äúpersevere.‚Äù  \n\n3. Kill the jargon. Call failure what it is! See it as a welcome chance to redirect efforts where they can give better returns.  \n\nIn innovation, the first step to progress isn‚Äôt moving faster - it‚Äôs stopping what doesn‚Äôt work. \n\nSo, next time you‚Äôre tempted to hire a consultant to ride that dead horse, ask yourself: \n\nüëâ Is it time to dismount? üêé\n\nLeadership isn‚Äôt about saving face. It‚Äôs about making smart exits - so you can find a horse that can take you places!\n\nAgree? Share your ‚Äúdead horse‚Äù stories (we‚Äôve all got ‚Äôem) in the comments. üê¥üíÄ  \n\n#Leadership #BusinessStrategy #Innovation #FailFast #SunkCostFallacy",

But failures? Each is a unique cautionary tale. And that‚Äôs where the real lessons lie.  \n\nTake UniSuper, a massive Australian fund. \n\nTheir 2024 cloud meltdown (yes, an entire account was accidentally deleted) made headlines. But the real story started earlier.  \n\nIn 2023, they were racing toward a ‚Äúrecord-fast‚Äù cloud migration.\n\nTheir strategy? Familiarity over reinvention:  \n\n- ‚úÖ ‚ÄùMinimal effort and disruption‚Ä¶ greater scale and agility.‚Äù\n\n- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúTechnology the team is already used to‚Ä¶ no need to rebuild apps.‚Äù\n\n- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúGet into the cloud quickly and safely.‚Äù\n\nSound smart? On paper, yes. \n\nBut here‚Äôs the truth: Shortcuts don‚Äôt eliminate hard work - they just delay it. \n\nEven without the catastrophic deletion, their approach would‚Äôve backfired. \n\nAvoiding cloud-native architecture? \n\nSkipping app modernization? \n\nThat debt always comes due. IT sprawl, hidden costs, scalability walls - it‚Äôs not if, but when. \n\nThe takeaway?\n\nCloud migrations aren‚Äôt just about speed or sticking with what‚Äôs familiar. \n\nThey‚Äôre about doing the foundational work - even when it‚Äôs painful.  \n\nWhat‚Äôs your take?

Don‚Äôt expect much commitment or passion.‚Äù\n\nMy gut said otherwise. \n\nSure, some resisted change - but indifferent? \n\nI refused to believe that. \n\nLater, I realized this ‚Äúadvice‚Äù was part of the play for the team member to paint themselves as the given team lead - an idea that had been planted by the prior manager. \n\nBut the seed of doubt lingered: \n\nCould some truly be unmotivated?\n\nI pushed hard. \n\nI rallied for change, emphasized purpose, and celebrated small wins. \n\nYet, a few remained disengaged. \n\nThe breakthrough came not from persuasion, but evolution. \n\nAs some team members moved on, we recruited believers - people who thrived on ownership, change and operational excellence. \n\nA core formed, blending tenured and new members, all invested in the mission.  \n\nJim Collins nailed it: ‚ÄùGet the right people on the bus.‚Äù\n\nSuccess wasn‚Äôt about forcing buy-in; it was about fostering a team that wanted to drive.  \n\nLesson learned: Cynicism often masks hidden agendas - or mismatched roles. \n\nAs leaders, we don‚Äôt just manage people; we curate cultures. \n\nWhen you align purpose with the right talent, ‚Äúindifferent‚Äù teams transform into engines of impact.  \n\n#Leadership #TeamBuilding #ChangeManagement #EngineeringLeadership #GrowthMindset\n\nP.S. If you're wondering what was Marval and why it was being killed, it was an ITSM software that the team rallied around to replace for Jira that was a much better fit with the company and our ways of working. D.S.\n\nP.P.S. A well deserved shoutout to the amazing NetEnt Change Management team that drove and made possible much needed change of the process, tooling and ways of working: Robert Hallam, Johanna B√§ckstr√∂m, Ann-Charlotte Ekstedt and Johanna Furborg!

However, one woman in tech has inspired me more than any other: my mother.  \n\nIn her late thirties, after working in accounting for half her life, my mother decided to make a career change and dive into the world of computers. This was in the 1990s, and I vividly remember our discussions about whose turn it was to use the family PC.  \n\nWhile my mom had a natural technical inclination and curiosity, I still recall the countless evenings she spent poring over course materials, determined to understand how everything worked.  \n\nHer hard work, late nights, and dedication to learning eventually paid off. She went on to spend the rest of her career as a systems administrator and a computer teacher at an elementary school, retiring just a few years ago.  \n\nHer relentless drive, her enduring thirst for learning about computers and technology, and her patience in experimenting and mastering new skills have left a lasting impression on me.  \n\nI‚Äôm now truly excited for this year‚Äôs #WIT conference and the opportunity to reconnect with old colleagues and meet new ones. \n\nSee you at Women in Tech 2025!\n\n#womenintech #sebtech #seblife #lifeatseb",

        "text": "üöÄ The CI/CD Conundrum: Why Are Only 40% of Applications Delivered Using CI/CD? ü§î\n\nA few months ago, I had a fascinating conversation with Richard Seroter, and one statistic he shared has been living rent-free in my head ever since: \n\nONLY 40% of applications globally are delivered to production using CI/CD.\n\nJust think about it! \n\nAs someone who‚Äôs been knee-deep in the continuous delivery space for over 9 years, this number surprised me. \n\nBack in 2016, my team and I took our first leap into CI/CD with a Java-based monolith running on a RedHat Linux VM. \n\nBefore CI/CD, delivering our platform to hundreds of customers took us a year, give or take.\n\nAfter CI/CD? \n\nWe were shipping new versions several times a year. The difference was night and day.\n\nBut let‚Äôs rewind to the pre-CI/CD days for a moment. \n\nRemember manual deployments? \n\nOh, the horror! I recall well our 47-step checklists (yes, 47!) to push an update to production. \n\nOne missed step, and boom - our platform would go down faster than a Jenga tower in an earthquake. \n\nThere was this one time when someone accidentally skipped step 23 (restarting the server), and we spent the next 2 hours troubleshooting why the application was ‚Äúacting weird.‚Äù Spoiler: it wasn‚Äôt the application; it was us. üòÖ\n\nOr how about the time we deployed a critical hotfix at 2 a.m., only to realize we‚Äôd forgotten to include a configuration file? \n\nPicture the frantic Slack messages, groggy engineers, and a lot of coffee. \n\nIt was like a bad sitcom episode, except no one was laughing.\n\nCI/CD changed all that. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt just about speed; it was about reliability, repeatability, and sanity.\n\nAs Martin Fowler famously said, \n\n‚ÄùContinuous Delivery is a series of practices that reduce the friction of releasing software.‚Äù\n\nAnd boy, did it reduce friction. \n\nSuddenly, deployments weren‚Äôt a white-knuckle, all-hands-on-deck affair. They were routine, predictable, and - dare I say it - boring. And that‚Äôs exactly how we wanted it.\n\nSo, why are only 40% of applications delivered using CI/CD? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è \n\nIs it legacy systems holding us back? \n\nFear of change? \n\nLack of tooling? \n\nWhatever the reason, it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs still a lot of room for improvement. \n\nIf you‚Äôre part of the 60% still on the fence, let me tell you: the grass is greener on the CI/CD side. \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre already there, share your favorite CI/CD war stories in the comments.\n\n#DevOps #CIDC #ContinuousDelivery #SoftwareEngineering #WarStories #TechHumor",

        "text": "Adolf Hitler's dismantling of democracy in Germany occurred decisively after he was appointed Chancellor on January 30, 1933. \n\nOver the next 53 days, he and the Nazi Party used a combination of legal maneuvers, propaganda, intimidation, and violence to consolidate power. \n\nBelow is a timeline of key events:\n\nüëâ Jan 30, 1933: Hitler Appointed Chancellor\n\n- President Paul von Hindenburg appoints Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, believing he can be controlled by conservative politicians.\n- Hitler leads a coalition government, with the Nazis holding only a few key positions.\n\nüëâ Feb 1, 1933: Reichstag Dissolved\n\n- Hitler convinces Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag and call for new elections on March 5, 1933, aiming to secure a Nazi majority.\n\nüëâ Feb 4, 1933: Decree for the Protection of the German People\n\n- Hitler issues a decree restricting press freedom and public gatherings, targeting political opponents, especially communists and socialists.\n- This allows the Nazis to suppress opposition voices and control the narrative.\n\nüëâ Feb 27, 1933: Reichstag Fire\n\n- The Reichstag building is set on fire. A Dutch communist, Marinus van der Lubbe, is arrested and blamed for the fire.\n- Hitler uses the fire as a pretext to claim that Germany is under threat from a communist uprising.\n\nüëâ Feb 28, 1933: Reichstag Fire Decree\n\n- Hindenburg signs the \"Decree for the Protection of the People and the State\", which suspends civil liberties:\n  - Freedom of speech, press, and assembly are abolished.\n  - Warrants for arrests and searches are no longer required.\n  - The decree allows the Nazis to arrest and detain political opponents, particularly communists, without trial.\n\nüëâ Mar 5, 1933: Reichstag Elections\n\n- The Nazi Party wins 43.9% of the vote, gaining 288 seats in the Reichstag but falling short of a majority.\n- Hitler forms a coalition with the nationalist DNVP party, giving him a slim majority.\n- The Nazis use intimidation, violence, and propaganda to influence the election results.\n\nüëâ Mar 8-12, 1933: Seizure of State Governments\n\n- Nazi officials take control of state governments across Germany, using force and coercion to replace elected officials with Nazi loyalists.\n- This centralizes power under Hitler's regime.\n\nüëâ Mar 23, 1933: Enabling Act (Erm√§chtigungsgesetz)\n\n- The Reichstag passes the Enabling Act, which grants Hitler the power to enact laws without parliamentary approval.\n- The act effectively ends democracy in Germany, allowing Hitler to rule by decree.\n- The Nazis use intimidation and violence to ensure the act's passage, arresting communist deputies and pressuring others to vote in favor.\n\nThis 53-day period marks the rapid transformation of Germany from a fragile democracy to a totalitarian dictatorship under Hitler's rule. \n\nThe Enabling Act, in particular, serves as the legal foundation for Nazi dictatorship, allowing Hitler to bypass the constitution and rule unchecked.\n\n#historydoesntrepeatitselfbutitoftenrhymes",

        "text": "Leadership isn‚Äôt defined by the easy days. It‚Äôs defined by how you handle the hard ones. \n\nThe moments that keep you up at night - letting people go, conducting salary reviews, giving feedback on behavior or performance - these are the moments that separate great leaders from the rest.  \n\nHere‚Äôs the truth: there‚Äôs no way to dodge the hard stuff.\n\nAvoiding tough conversations doesn‚Äôt make them disappear; it only makes things worse. \n\nPeople deserve clarity, honesty, and respect - whether you‚Äôre celebrating their wins or addressing their challenges.  \n\nWhat I‚Äôve learned over the years:  \n\n‚úÖ Positive feedback should be immediate and public. Celebrate wins as soon as they happen - it fuels motivation and builds trust.  \n\n‚úÖ Negative feedback should be private and respectful. It‚Äôs not about tearing someone down; it‚Äôs about helping them grow.  \n\n‚úÖ Every situation is different. People are unique, and their reactions will vary. Adaptability and empathy are key.  \n\nAs leaders, we have to lean into the discomfort. \n\nIt‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs necessary. \n\nAs Brene Brown once said, ‚ÄúClear is kind. Unclear is unkind.‚Äù\n\nAnd Simon Sinek reminds us that \n\n‚ÄúLeadership is not about being in charge. It‚Äôs about taking care of those in your charge.‚Äù\n\nSo, let‚Äôs commit to showing up - fully, honestly, and with compassion - even when it‚Äôs hard. \n\nBecause that‚Äôs what great leadership is all about.  \n\nWhat‚Äôs the hardest leadership lesson you‚Äôve learned?  \n\n#Leadership #HardConversations #FeedbackCulture #EmpathyInLeadership #GrowthMindset",

        "text": "Meetings. The word alone sends shivers down the spine of even the most seasoned professional. \n\nThey are the corporate world‚Äôs double-edged sword: a necessary evil for collaboration, yet often a black hole of productivity. \n\nAs someone who is fairly caught up in meetings, I‚Äôve come to view them with a healthy dose of skepticism. \n\nIf a meeting lacks a clear agenda, purpose, or actionable outcomes, it‚Äôs not a meeting - it‚Äôs a time-wasting ritual.\n\nLet‚Äôs face it: not every problem requires a meeting. \n\nAs Jason Fried, co-founder of Basecamp, once said, ‚ÄúMeetings are the graveyards of productivity.‚Äù\n\nToo often, they are called out of habit, not necessity. \n\nThe result? A room full of people nodding along, half-listening, while their to-do lists grow longer by the minute. \n\nAnd don‚Äôt even get me started on back-to-back meetings. These are the ultimate productivity killers, leaving no room for breathing, let alone thinking.\n\nThe human brain isn‚Äôt designed to switch contexts every 30 minutes. \n\nCal Newport, author of ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù, argues that meaningful productivity requires uninterrupted focus. \n\nBack-to-back meetings fracture your day into tiny shards, leaving you exhausted but unaccomplished. \n\nYou end up as a meeting zombie üßü - physically present but mentally checked out, with a mountain of action points and no time to tackle them.\n\nSo, how do we fight this meeting inflation? \n\nStart by asking the hard questions: ‚ÄúDoes this meeting need to happen? What‚Äôs the goal? What‚Äôs the agenda? What actions may come out of it?‚Äù \n\nIf you can‚Äôt answer these, cancel the meeting. Period. \n\nDon‚Äôt let your calendar become a battleground of inefficiency.\n\nNext, build slack into your day. \n\nWhether you call it thinking time, reflection time, or just plain old work time, it‚Äôs essential. \n\nWithout it, you‚Äôre just a cog in the machine, grinding away without purpose. \n\nAs Anne Lamott wisely put it, ‚ÄúAlmost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.‚Äù \n\nGive yourself the space to recharge, prioritize, and actually get things done.\n\nIn the end, meetings should serve us, not the other way around. \n\nA life spent in meetings isn‚Äôt a life - it‚Äôs a slow descent into zombiehood. And no one wants to be a meeting zombie. üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

        "text": "The Tito-Stalin Split of 1948 and the #Russian invasion of #Ukraine share some parallels, particularly in terms of power dynamics, national sovereignty, and resistance to external domination. \n\nüëâ #Struggle for #National #Sovereignty\n\n- #Yugoslavia sought to maintain its independence from #Soviet control, asserting its right to pursue its own path to socialism. #Tito resisted Stalin's attempts to dictate Yugoslavia's domestic and foreign policies.\n \n- Ukraine has similarly sought to assert its sovereignty and independence from Russian influence, particularly since the #Euromaidan #Revolution in 2014. Ukraine's desire to integrate with Western institutions has been a direct challenge to Russia's vision of a sphere of influence in the post-Soviet era.\n\nüëâ #Resistance to #Hegemonic #Control\n\n- #Stalin viewed Tito's independence as a threat to the unity of the communist bloc and his own authority as the leader of global communism. He attempted to undermine Tito through propaganda, espionage, and pressure on other Eastern Bloc countries to isolate Yugoslavia.\n\n- Russia, under Vladimir #Putin, views Ukraine's pro-Western orientation as a threat to its own hegemony in the region. Russia has used a combination of military aggression (e.g., the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion in 2022), propaganda, and economic pressure to undermine Ukraine's independence.\n\nüëâ #Ideological and #Cultural Dimensions\n\n- Yugoslavia promoted a unique form of #socialism (e.g., workers' self-management) and a multi-ethnic, federal state structure. This stood in contrast to Stalin's rigid, centralized model of socialism and his emphasis on Soviet dominance.\n\n- Ukraine's pursuit of democracy, European integration, and a distinct national identity contrasts sharply with Russia's authoritarian model and its claims of a shared \"Russian world\" (#Russkiy #Mir) that includes Ukraine. Ukraine's cultural and linguistic revival, particularly since 2014, has been a direct challenge to Russia's historical narrative of Ukraine as part of a greater Russian sphere.\n\nüëâ #Propaganda and #Disinformation\n\n- Stalin launched a propaganda campaign against Tito, accusing him of betraying socialism and being a \"fascist\" and \"imperialist agent.\" This was an attempt to discredit Tito and justify Yugoslavia's isolation.\n\n- Russia has used extensive propaganda and disinformation to portray Ukraine as a \"fascist\" state, particularly since the Euromaidan Revolution. This narrative has been used to justify Russian #aggression and undermine Ukraine's legitimacy on the global stage.\n\nThe parallels between the Tito-Stalin Split and the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlight recurring themes of national sovereignty, resistance to external domination, and the struggle for independence in the face of hegemonic powers. \n\nBoth cases demonstrate the challenges smaller nations face when asserting their independence against larger, more powerful neighbors.\n\n#slavaukraini",

        "text": "As I scroll through my LinkedIn feed, the calls for #European #digitalsovereignty are growing louder, and for good reasons. \n\nWith shifting geopolitical dynamics, Europe must step up as a bastion of democratic values and technological autonomy. \n\nBut how do we achieve digital sovereignty in practice? \n\nThe path is neither simple nor quick, and it begins with a fundamental shift in how we approach technology - starting with conscious #dependencymanagement. \n\nAt its core, digital sovereignty is about autonomy - the ability to control where and how our digital systems operate. But autonomy starts with visibility. \n\nIf we don‚Äôt understand what goes into our applications - from libraries and binaries to APIs and external integrations - we‚Äôre effectively locked into the ecosystems where those applications run.  \n\nConscious dependency management means having full #visibility into every component of an application. It means knowing:  \n\n- What #libraries and #frameworks are being used?\n\n- Where are #binaries and #images sourced from?\n\n- What external #APIs or #services are integrated?\n\n- How do these dependencies impact the application‚Äôs #portability and #adaptability?\n\nWhen you have this level of insight, you‚Äôre in a better position to modify, adapt, and migrate your applications as needed. \n\nHowever, dependency management is often seen as a back-end, technical concern - one that doesn‚Äôt directly impact revenue or customer experience.\n\nAs a result, many companies only address dependencies when they‚Äôre forced to - during a #migration, a #security breach, or a #compliance audit. \n\nBy then, it‚Äôs often too late to make meaningful changes without significant cost and disruption.  \n\nSo, how do we shift this mindset and make dependency management a priority? \n\nHere are a few steps to consider:  \n\n1. Educate and Advocate: \nStart by raising awareness about the importance of dependency management. Explain how it ties into broader goals like digital sovereignty, security, and #resilience.\n\n2. Invest in Tools and Processes: \nImplement tools that provide visibility into application dependencies. From software composition analysis (SCA) to API #monitoring, there are solutions available to help you map out your application‚Äôs ecosystem.  \n\n3. Embed Dependency Management into Development: \nMake dependency management a core part of your #softwaredevelopmentlifecycle (SDLC). Encourage developers to document dependencies, evaluate alternatives, and prioritize #opensource where possible.  \n\n4. Foster a Culture of Ownership: Dependency management isn‚Äôt the sole responsibility of IT or security teams. It‚Äôs a #sharedresponsibility that requires buy-in from leadership, developers, and operations teams alike.  \n\nAchieving digital sovereignty won‚Äôt happen overnight. It will require sustained effort, investment, and collaboration. \n\nBut by starting with conscious dependency management, we can lay the groundwork for a more autonomous, resilient, and sovereign digital future.",

Regardless if born in Venice or the Croatian island of Korƒçula, he ventured across continents, not just to trade goods but to exchange ideas, cultures, and stories. \n\nHis journey wasn‚Äôt just about geography; it was about transformation.\n\nAs he once said, ‚ÄúI did not tell half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed.‚Äù\n\nHis words resonate deeply in today‚Äôs interconnected world. \n\nHow many of us have felt the same? We move, we adapt, we grow, and sometimes our experiences feel too vast to articulate. \n\nYet, it‚Äôs in this fluidity that we find our true strength.\n\nToday, we are all Marco Polos in our own right. \n\nWe‚Äôre born in one place, study in another, and build careers in yet another. We fall in love with people, cultures, and opportunities that take us far from our roots. And in doing so, we redefine what it means to belong.\n\nEach of us carries a unique story, a mosaic of experiences that shapes our identity.\n\nAs one of my friends once told me, \n\n‚ÄúHome isn‚Äôt where you‚Äôre born; it‚Äôs where you become yourself.‚Äù\n\nThis sentiment captures the essence of our modern journeys. \n\nWe are not defined by a single place or role but by the sum of our experiences.\n\nMarco Polo‚Äôs story reminds us that adaptation is the key to thriving in a fluid world. \n\nHe didn‚Äôt just survive his journey - he thrived by embracing the unknown. \n\nHe learned new languages, built relationships across cultures, and found opportunity in the unfamiliar.\n\nIn today‚Äôs world, adaptability is our greatest asset. \n\nWhether it‚Äôs learning a new skill, navigating a career pivot, or building a life in a new country, our ability to adapt defines our success.\n\nLinkedIn is the modern Silk Road - a platform where ideas, opportunities, and stories intersect. \n\nIt‚Äôs where a professional in New York can collaborate with a startup in Nairobi, or where someone in Tokyo can find mentorship from an expert in Berlin. \n\nOur profiles may list our current roles, but our stories are so much richer.\n\nSo, to all the modern Marco Polos out there: your journey matters!\n\nYour fluid identity is not a limitation - it‚Äôs your superpower! \n\nShare your story, embrace the unknown, and remember that every step you take adds to the richness of your narrative.\n\nAs I reflect on my own journey - born in one country, educated in another, having built a career that spans industries and borders - I‚Äôm reminded of the power of connection. \n\nLet‚Äôs continue to learn from each other and celebrate the beauty of our fluid identities.\n\nWhat‚Äôs your Marco Polo story?\n\n#identity #careerjourney #adaptibility #marcopolo #globalcitizen #growthmindset\n\nPS.

The boat has a hole in it, and water is leaking in. \n\nThat hole represents tariffs, quotas, and protectionist policies that make trade inefficient and harm economic growth.\n\nNow, suppose other countries also have boats with holes in them - meaning they, too, impose protectionist measures.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\n- A protectionist would argue: ‚ÄúOther boats have holes, so we should drill more holes in our own boat to be ‚Äòfair‚Äô and ‚Äòcompetitive‚Äô!‚Äù\n\n- Friedman argues: ‚ÄúThe rational response is to plug the holes in your own boat and make it as seaworthy as possible - regardless of what other boats do!‚Äù\n\nFriedman‚Äôs analogy explains that just because other countries impose tariffs and trade restrictions doesn‚Äôt mean your country should do the same. \n\nRetaliatory tariffs only hurt domestic consumers by making goods more expensive and less efficient. \n\nInstead of engaging in economic self-harm, a country should embrace free trade even if others don‚Äôt - because free trade benefits consumers and businesses alike.\n\nIn short, drilling more holes in your boat to match someone else‚Äôs isn‚Äôt strategy - it‚Äôs self-sabotage.",

        "text": "Just finished the audiobook ‚ÄúHow the Mighty Fall‚Äù by #Jim #Collins, and I found it quite insightful. \n\nCollins doesn‚Äôt just diagnose organizational failure; he provides concrete cues for how to detect and potentially reverse decline. \n\nThe author outlines five stages of decline, describing how successful organizations falter and, in some cases, fail completely. \n\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown of the stages:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Hubris Born of Success\n\nSuccess leads to overconfidence and arrogance. Leaders start to take their success for granted, assuming their strategies will always work.\n\nKey signs:\n- Ignoring the fundamentals that initially drove success.\n- Believing the organization is ‚Äútoo big to fail.‚Äù\n- Losing focus on the core mission or customers.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Undisciplined Pursuit of More\n\nThe organization overreaches, chasing growth, diversification, or success in areas outside its strengths.\n\nKey signs:\n- Expanding too quickly without strategic discipline.\n- Pursuing growth at the expense of quality or long-term sustainability.\n- Neglecting the core business or what the organization does best.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Denial of Risk and Peril\n\nLeaders fail to recognize warning signs and dismiss evidence of risks or challenges. Success blinds them to emerging threats.\n\nKey signs:\n- Rationalizing bad results instead of addressing the root causes.\n- Overconfidence in the organization‚Äôs ability to recover.\n- Downplaying external shifts, such as market changes or competitor innovations.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Grasping for Salvation\n\nIn response to mounting problems, the organization takes desperate actions - often bold but unsustainable - in an attempt to quickly regain success.\n\nKey signs:\n- Focusing on quick fixes like flashy acquisitions or leadership overhauls.\n- Abandoning disciplined strategies in favor of risky moves.\n- Looking for a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù solution rather than incremental progress.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nThe organization either becomes irrelevant in its market or collapses entirely. At this stage, recovery is unlikely or impossible.\n\nKey signs:\n- Loss of talent and customers.\n- Bankruptcy, closure, or absorption by another company.\n- An irreversible loss of purpose or competitive edge.\n\nThe five stages are both intuitive and obvious, although remarkably hard to see when one‚Äôs in the beginning or the middle of a stage.\n\nHaving seen the five stages play out first hand while I was at #Nokia, I can personally testify to their accuracy. \n\nIt‚Äôs good to remember that decline is not inevitable or irreversible until the later stages. \n\nIf identified and addressed early (stages 1 - 3), organizations can take corrective action to regain their footing. \n\nLeadership discipline, humility, and a focus on core strengths are essential to recovery.\n\n‚ÄùHow the Mighty Fall‚Äù is a must-read for leaders who want to prevent organizational decline - or navigate their way out of it. \n\nThe message is clear: \n\nDecline is not inevitable if you remain disciplined, humble, and focused on your core purpose.",

If men were not equal, they could neither understand each other, nor understand their predecessors, nor make plans for the future and foresee the needs of their successors.‚Äù\n\nIn a world divided by polarization, her teachings urge us to embrace diversity as a strength.\n\nüëâ The Role of Truth in Politics\nArendt warned that when facts are undermined, public discourse becomes chaotic. \n\n‚ÄúThe ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction‚Ä¶no longer exists.‚Äù \n\nHer words challenge us to defend truth in an age of disinformation.\n\nüëâ The Need for Critical Thinking\nAbove all, Arendt believed that thoughtlessness is a dangerous state. \n\n‚ÄùEvil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there. That is the banality of evil.‚Äù \n\nIn today‚Äôs fast-paced, algorithm-driven world, her call to ‚Äúthink what we are doing‚Äù reminds us to reflect deeply on our choices and their impact.\n\nArendt‚Äôs timeless ideas push us to engage meaningfully in our communities, safeguard democratic values, and remain vigilant against forces that threaten freedom and human dignity. \n\n#criticalthinking #democracy #HannahArendt #plurality #truth #facts #totalitarianism",

The Kinect added to that legacy by creating an entirely new way to play. \n\nIt‚Äôs incredible how #gaming can bring generations together, whether it‚Äôs revisiting classics or exploring the latest tech. \n\nFor me, the Kinect isn‚Äôt just about nostalgia - it‚Äôs about the timeless fun of playing together, controller-free. \n\nWhat are your favorite gaming memories, whether old or new? I‚Äôd love to hear about the consoles, games, or moments that have left a lasting impact on you and your family!",

He shared how overwhelmed he felt by the sheer number of acronyms our team used - myself included.\n\nSometimes, he‚Äôd stop and ask what an acronym stood for. Other times, he‚Äôd jot it down to ask later. But more often than not, he‚Äôd let it pass, unsure of its meaning, and wait for context to fill in the gaps.\n\nIt was a wake-up call. While we thought acronyms made us efficient - or perhaps made us sound more skilled - what they actually did was create a barrier for one of our team members to fully understand and contribute.\n\nThat day, I made a promise to myself: \n\nI‚Äôd always try to clarify acronyms if there was even the slightest chance someone in the room might not understand.\n\nSure, sometimes the explanation feels unnecessary. \n\nBut other times, a nod, a smile, or even just a look of relief tells me it was worth it. It‚Äôs a small act that goes a long way toward fostering inclusion and making everyone feel part of the conversation.\n\nAs Albert Einstein once said:\n\n‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt explain it simply, you don‚Äôt understand it well enough.‚Äù\n\nLanguage, like leadership, is meant to build bridges, not walls.\n\nHave you had a similar moment where someone‚Äôs feedback helped you grow as a leader?

Some are well-known classics, while others are less common yet equally valuable:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Adoption\n\t‚Ä¢\tMeasures the proportion of infrastructure managed through code.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Higher adoption ensures consistency, scalability, and reduced manual errors.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Testing Coverage\n\t‚Ä¢\tEvaluates how much of the infrastructure is tested automatically.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Greater coverage catches issues early, leading to more reliable deployments.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Frequency\n\t‚Ä¢\tTracks how often the team releases new updates or features.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: High frequency signals agility and streamlined processes.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)\n\t‚Ä¢\tMeasures the average time to restore services after an incident.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Lower MTTR reflects robust incident response and recovery mechanisms.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Change Failure Rate\n\t‚Ä¢\tCalculates the percentage of changes that result in failures requiring remediation.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: A low rate reflects effective change management and deployment quality.\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Service Level Objectives (SLOs) Compliance\n\t‚Ä¢\tMonitors adherence to defined performance and reliability targets.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Consistent compliance demonstrates strong service management practices.\n\n7Ô∏è‚É£ Incident Frequency and Severity\n\t‚Ä¢\tTracks the number and impact of incidents over time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: A declining trend indicates improved stability and proactive issue management.\n\n8Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Documentation Quality\n\t‚Ä¢\tAssesses the comprehensiveness and accessibility of documentation.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: High-quality docs support efficient onboarding, troubleshooting, and scalability.\n\n9Ô∏è‚É£ On-Call Metrics\n\t‚Ä¢\tEvaluates the health and effectiveness of on-call practices, including response times and workload balance.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: Healthy on-call practices foster resilience and avoid burnout.\n\nüîü Continuous Improvement Initiatives\n\t‚Ä¢\tMonitors the implementation of lessons learned from post-incident reviews and proactive process enhancements.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhy it matters: A commitment to continuous improvement shows operational excellence.\n\nüëâ Did I miss any important metrics, or do these provide a fairly comprehensive reflection of an infrastructure team‚Äôs operational maturity?

        "text": "Good to Great: Lessons Beyond Business\n\nI recently finished Jim Collins‚Äô classic Good to Great, and it struck me how its principles extend far beyond business - they apply to #life, #leadership, and #personalgrowth.\n\nThe book explores why some companies transition from mediocrity to excellence while others fail to sustain greatness. \n\nCollins distills this into actionable principles, many of which resonate on a deeply personal level:\n\n1. The #Hedgehog Concept\nGreat companies (and individuals) thrive at the intersection of three things: what they are deeply passionate about, what they can be the best at, and what drives their economic (or life) engine. This applies to personal purpose too - when we align our #skills, #passions, and #opportunities, we position ourselves for meaningful #growth.\n\n2. Level 5 Leadership\n#Humility combined with fierce #resolve defines great leaders. This principle isn‚Äôt just about leading companies - it‚Äôs about showing up in every aspect of life with a servant‚Äôs heart and a relentless commitment to #excellence.\n\n3. First Who, Then What\nCollins emphasizes getting the #rightpeople ‚Äúon the bus‚Äù before deciding the #direction. In life, this means surrounding yourself with people who share your values and uplift you, whether professionally or personally.\n\n4. The #Flywheel Effect\nMomentum builds from #consistent, #disciplined #effort. Success isn‚Äôt about one big leap; it‚Äôs about pushing the flywheel forward, one disciplined turn at a time. This idea encourages #patience and #persistence in achieving goals.\n\n5. #Confront the Brutal #Facts\nGreatness requires an unflinching commitment to #reality. Whether in #relationships, #careers, or personal #goals, honesty about challenges is the foundation of growth.\n\nThe brilliance of ‚ÄùGood to Great‚Äù lies in its simplicity and universality. \n\nIt‚Äôs a roadmap not only for building great companies but for leading a life of purpose, discipline, and impact.",
