> I have wanted to start journaling for a really long time but have always come up with some reason or excuse not to. This time, I will try to make journaling to be about things, topics and aha-moments I encounter on a daily basis, that might also be interesting for others to learn about or discover.

* Ars Technica is writing a [piece](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-assistant-might-be-doomed-division-reorganizes-to-focus-on-bard/) on Google refocusing efforts from Google Assistant to Bard. Just like [Alexa](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/) it seems Google Assistant, isn't making any money for the parent companies.

* An interesting ROI measurement on [Backstage](https://backstage.io) was released today by Spotify. The developers that use Backstage are both more productive, content and retained longer at the company than non-users of Backstage. Check out the analysis right [here](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-measures-backstage-roi/?utm_campaign=FY23%20-%20Blog%3A%20Backstage%20by%20the%20Numbers&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Xr0BcvVUXCm3gpI6IcWUIEqZqf1Ipoh6e7k94ex9oDnKWezlF0ar3heqk-gCosVcpnn85UJ0hB04QsUohmkitcVqHMw&_hsmi=252403474&utm_content=252403474&utm_source=hs_email&hsCtaTracking=08661d3f-d640-454b-bf55-ac04726b1ad3%7Cd00f0188-d378-4e37-9530-ded38d534323). <br/><br/>

* The leaps in AI are just massive. Here's a driverless [Cruise](https://getcruise.com) vehicle making its way through North Beach on St. Patrick's day. Seems AVs will be able to take on pretty hairy situations quite soon. Link to the [video](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046893618195795968/).<br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"I can make the trains run on time. But that trait is not conducive to being a leader. That’s a great trait for being a manager. Leadership is a vision. It’s inspiration, it's execution, it’s instincts. It is not just letting the trains run on time."* From [20VC podcast episode with Sequoia'a Doug Leone](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1WuBfXCeERhgiXloheaaoo?si=QZlnTjvHStGEknTcPzFIPA&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A3j2KMcZTtgTNBKwtZBMHvl).<br/><br/>

* Had great fun at a meet-up co-arranged with [Continuous Delivery Stockholm](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_cloud-cicd-continuousdelivery-activity-7046954939008303104-2XUk). Really glad to contribute in any way I can getting the meet-up scene going after too many years of pandemic. <br/><br/>
* Deep fakes and online bank runs are a scary combo. In a digital first world, toppling banks in an online bank run, happens at amazing speeds. And as deep fakes, with the help of AI, are becoming all the more plausible and believable, the risk of a deep fake video causing a run has become all the greater. [Bloomberg Opinion article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/28/online-fakery-and-digital-bank-runs-are-a-scary-mix/1a63d426-cd57-11ed-8907-156f0390d081_story.html)<br/><br/>
* Stumbled upon [Minimum Viable Secure Product Controls checklist](https://mvsp.dev/mvsp.en/) while listening to episode 114 of [Cloud Security podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/515p7nUYU8MUdzyGfMuB9H). It's a quite usable minimalistic security checklist for B2B software and business process outsourcing suppliers.

## 28 March 2023
* Trying out [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai) iPhone app. It's like ChatGPT but with cited sources and voice searches. Perplexity is backed by some of the key people and pioneers in search, consumer products, and artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>
* [Cloud Security Podcast](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/cloudsecurity/podcast/ep96-cloud-security-observability-for-detection-and-response/) Episode 96 has some interesting insights and take-aways from Jeff Bollinger, Director of Incident Response and Detection Engineering at LinkedIn. The episode focuses on how to best approach observability in Cloud. One of many good take-aways is on using defined but not used subnets as honeypots. <br/><br/>
* Goldman Sachs estimates that two-thirds of current jobs in the US and the European Union are exposed to some degree of AI automation. Administrative and legal sectors are expected to be the most impacted, with 46% of administrative jobs and 44% of legal jobs being substitutable by AI. 
The research shows that AI will impact roughly half of the activities people do across all sectors, and nearly all occupations will be affected by automation. [Financial Times article](https://www.ft.com/content/50b15701-855a-4788-9a4b-5a0a9ee10561)

* Sequoia Capital's [newest market map](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFYS4hT4yMi3g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1679679479724?e=1682553600&v=beta&t=t-B1CLx2ddYGvLA55ipMj1AwrMfqGHJsGR4R9kxZ6sk). It showcases Sequoia's belief that that the AI revolution is the most consequential computational trend in decades. AI is rewriting what software can do and expanding the pool of who can write software. Full article [here](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/). <br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"Skipping software tests to save time is like getting a head start in a race by not tying your shoes. You're not getting ahead, you're going to stumble."* <br/><br/>
* Sequoia [article](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/) on Generative AI predicts rise of "killer" apps just like smartphones 15 years ago unleashed new types of applications through new capabilities like GPS, cameras and on-the-go connectivity. The article speculates how different fundamental models will evolve over the coming years and what sort of associated applications will become possible. <br/>

* Weekend time with the family and we watched the movie **Lorax** from 2012, based upon a book by Dr. Seuss. A good movie for the whole family with a great quote for future saving. <br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind, don't matter, and those who matter, don't mind."* - Dr. Seuss<br/><br/>
* Recent years, months and weeks have seen a remarkable 
progress in the field of generative AI and large language models. This [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) made by OpenAI, Open Research and University of Pennsylvania investigates potential impact of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models on the US labour market. <br/><br/>
* The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/25/you-wait-ages-for-an-ai-chatbot-to-come-along-then-a-whole-bunch-turn-up-chatgpt) answers why the machine learning "breakthrough" moment happened to happen right now. A number of necessary but unconnected developments suddenly came together to create entirely new possibilities: 
"the availability of truly massive cloud-computing power; unimaginable quantities of data provided by the internet for training LLMs; significant improvements in algorithms boosted by neural networks; and oodles of money, provided by insanely profitable tech giants."<br/><br/>
* Reflecting on the US lawmakers grilling TikTok's CEO about it's ties to China. While I very well understand the US lawmakers's concerns about TikTok being (ab)used as a potential weapon against the free world, it's hard not to draw parallels between the Chinese National Security Law from 2017 and the American Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act or CLOUD Act from 2018.
