> Cloud Cloud Dot Dev is about things, topics and aha-moments I encounter on a daily basis that I think may be interesting for saving and that also may be interesting for others to learn about or discover.
<br/>

## 31 August 2023
* Failure Demand is demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for the customer. Customers come back, making further demands, unnecessarily consuming the organisation’s resources because the service they receive is ineffective. <br/><br/>

* [Everything](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230829-why-aperol-spritz-is-the-drink-of-the-summer) you wanted to know about Aperol Spritz but didn't have anyone to ask. 

## 28 August 2023
* No business model or competitive advantage is indefinitely sustainable.<br/><br/>
* Features delivered are not a measure of success; business outcomes are.<br/><br/>
* "*It's not enough to do your best; you must know what to do, and then do your best.*" - W. Edwards Deming <br/><br/>
* "*The single most important thing to remember about any enterprise is that there are no results inside its walls. The result of a business is a satisfied customer.*" - Peter Drucker<br/><br/>
* “*Emergencies have always been necessary to progress. It was darkness which produced the lamp. It was fog that produced the compass. It was hunger that drove us to exploration. And it took a depression to teach us the real value of a job.*” - Victor Hugo<br/><br/>
* "*Whenever there is fear, you will get wrong figures.*" - W. Edwards Deming

## 26 August 2023
* "*The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand. We listen to reply.*" - Stephen R. Covey

## 25 August 2023
* Words to live by. "*Our prime purpose in life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.*" - Dalia Lama 

## 24 August 2023
* "*You are a fool if you do just as I say. You are a greater fool if you don’t do as I say. You should think for yourself and come up with better ideas than mine.*” - Taiichi Ohno<br/><br/>
* “*People who can’t understand numbers are useless. The gemba where numbers are not visible is also bad. However, people who only look at the numbers are the worst of all.*" - Taiichi Ohno<br/><br/>
* "*Whether top management, middle management, or the workers who actually do the work, we are all human, so we're like walking misconceptions, believing that the way we do things now is the best way.*" - Taiichi Ohno<br/><br/>
* Underneath one Kaizen idea, is another one.<br/><br/>
* "*No plan survives contact with the enemy.*" - Helmuth von Moltke<br/><br/>
* Per aspera ad astra. / Through hardships to the stars.

## 22 August 2023
* "*I think we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt. I shouldn't wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy not even mine, not even mine. No, I think we should accept our philosophies with a measure of doubt.*" - Bertrand Russell <br/><br/>
* Romney Wheeler [interviews](https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/comedy/a-conversation-with-bertrand-russell-1952/) British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, and social critic Bertrand Russell at Russell’s home in Surrey, England. The interview was broadcast on his 80th birthday, which was May 18, 1952.

## 17 August 2023
* "*The Law of Crappy People states: For any title level in a large organization, the talent on that level will eventually converge to the crappiest person with the title. 
The rationale behind the law is that the other employees in the company with lower titles will naturally benchmark themselves against the crappiest person at the next level. 
For example, if Jasper is the worst vice president in the company, then all of the directors will benchmark themselves against Jasper and demand promotions as soon as they reach his low level of competency.*"- Ben Horowitz<br/><br/>
* The Peter Principle, coined by Dr. Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull in their 1969 book **The Peter Principle**, contends that, in a hierarchy, people are sooner or later 
promoted to positions which they are no longer skilled to handle. This is their “level of incompetence.” This is where they stay.
In his book **High Output Management**, Andy Grove points out that this is largely unavoidable because there is no way to know a priori at what point the person will be incapable of handling further promotions.<br/><br/>
* "*MANAGING STRICTLY BY NUMBERS IS LIKE PAINTING BY NUMBERS Some things that you want to encourage will be quantifiable, and some will not. If you report on the quantitative goals and ignore the qualitative ones, you won’t get the qualitative goals, which may be the most important ones. Management purely by numbers is sort of like painting by numbers—it’s strictly for amateurs. At HP, the company wanted high earnings now and in the future. By focusing entirely on the numbers, HP got them now by sacrificing the future.*" - Ben Horowitz<br/><br/>
* "*We take care of the people, the products and the profits…in that order.*” - Jim Barksdale<br/><br/>
* Ben Horowitz recalls a situation as a PM at Netscape when there were no silver bullets, only [Lead Bullets](https://a16z.com/2011/11/13/lead-bullets/).

## 13 August 2023
* "*All decisions are objective until the first line of code is written. After that, all decisions are emotional.*” - Ben Horowitz in **Hard Thing about Hard Things**<br/><br/>
* "*If you're going to eat shit, don't nibble.*" - Ben Horowitz <br/><br/>
* "*It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.*" - Marcus Aurelius, **Meditations**<br/><br/>
* Came across the amazing story/book by Dr. Seuss from 1990, "Oh, the Places You'll Go". Reading and rereading it, and it's quickly becoming a new favourite. Read for yourself [here](https://denuccio.net/ohplaces.html).

## 23 July 2023
* Apple is so perturbed by a United Kingdom surveillance bill that it's threatening to flat-out remove iMessage and FaceTime in the U.K. instead of complying with the proposed legislation. On [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/apple-facetime-imessage-uk-surveillance-bill).

* Ganbaru (頑張る, lit. 'stand firm'), also romanized as gambaru, is a ubiquitous Japanese word which roughly means to slog on tenaciously through tough times. Gambaru focuses attention on the importance of finishing a task and never stopping until a goal is achieved. The continuing effort to overcome obstacles (even if not successful) is an important concept in Japan.<br/><br/>
* "*If we try to get rid of one wave with another, we end up with an infinite sea.*" - Zen saying<br/><br/>
* Hara hachi bun me (腹八分目) (also spelled hara hachi bu, and sometimes misspelled hari hachi bu) is a Confucian teaching that instructs people to eat until they are 80 percent full. 

## 11 July 2023
* "*Be Water, My Friend.
Empty your mind.
Be formless, shapeless, like water.
You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
Now water can flow or it can crash.
Be water, my friend.*" - Bruce Lee<br/><br/>
* Story of "Big Tech" rejections, before they were the "Big Tech". [Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonerlichman/status/1678178996125614081?s=46&t=hHSCE5QQcDTRoUCBsMmiCg)

## 5 July 2023
* "*A culture is strong when people work with each other, for each other.<br/>
A culture is weak when people work against each other, for themselves.*" - Simon Sinek<br/><br/>

* Jan Bosch has a good [post](https://janbosch.com/blog/index.php/2023/06/19/protagonist-rule-15-memento-mori/) on how to maximise one's life through three tactics: prioritization (only do what you feel is important), acceleration (don’t delay things but do them now) and desensitization (stop worrying about what others might think or what you might lose). 

## 23 June 2023
* After decades of stop-start progress, ML is now a reality due to the recent convergence of three factors: advanced algorithms, access to huge volumes of digital training data, and cheap, abundant computing power – available, of course, through
the cloud. <br/><br/>

This shift can have powerful business implications, such as reducing operating costs, increasing efficiency, and even making customers and employees happier.<br/><br/>

* Reading through a 2006 article with Werner Vogels where he amongst other things brings up the reasons behind ["You build it. You run it"](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065). <br/><br/>
* "*If it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong.*" - Richard Feynman <br/> In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn't make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong.<br/><br/>

## 13 June 2023

* "*Given a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time.*" - Jeff Bezos <br/><br/>
* "*Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.*" - Steve Jobs

## 8 June 2023
* "*Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.*" - E.F. Schumacher <br/><br/>

* "*We love to make great products that really enrich people’s lives. We love to integrate hardware, software and services seamlessly. We love to make technology more personal and allow our users to do things that they could never have imagined. We have been working incredibly hard for a long time on an entirely new product and we believe this product will redefine what people expect from its category. I am so excited and I am so proud to share it with you this morning. It is the next chapter in Apple’s story.*" - Tim Cook at the launch of Apple Watch 

## 6 June 2023
* Sweden's 500th birthday as free and independent nation is definitely cause for great celebration. To mark the occasion, here are five time tested Swedish [proverbs](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_sweden-500-swedense-activity-7071763188379246593-zmj1).

## 29 May 2023
* I was asked a while back to share the full list of my reads/listens. I found the request flattering but didn't think too much about it until I heard the same thing from another person, and then another. One is a dot, two is a line, three is a trend. Said and done, I've now extracted the list of books I've listened to from Audible since I started my monthly subscription in 2018. Think a few books from competing services are missing and I'll look to add those too shortly. As well of course hard copies of books, which I'll also add. To top it off, at some point, I will add more data about the books, including linking to my reviews on LinkedIn. Without any further ado, here is the [list](booklist.md).

## 27 May 2023
* At the end of the day, company in any type of business is now, a software company. 
Even if previously your core product didn’t have a software component, now it’s unlikely that your core product doesn’t come with a software element attached. 
Failing to do your best with that software component, is equal to failing at your core product.

## 26 May 2023
* A quick book [review](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_agile-lean-cloudcomputing-activity-7067741149242830848-udAi) on "The Journey to Enterprise Agility" by Daryl Kulak and Hong Li. The book is a good starting point, in case you're wondering how to develop effective interfaces between enterprise methodology and Agile practices. 

## 24 May 2023
* Tina Turner, the Queen of Rock'n'Roll, has died at 83. <br/>*"People think my life has been tough, but I think it's been a wonderful journey. The older you get, the more you realise it's not what happened, it's how you deal with it."*

## 19 May 2023
* An internal [document](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) from Google circulating reg Open Source and OpenAI. "*...in the end, OpenAI doesn’t matter. They are making the same mistakes we are in their posture relative to open source, and their ability to maintain an edge is necessarily in question. Open source alternatives can and will eventually eclipse them unless they change their stance. In this respect, at least, we can make the first move.*" 

## 15 May 2023
* [Short post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_commute-worklife-balance-activity-7063948475914231808-vTlj) on my commute to work, running through the forest in the Haga park.

* Unlike bridges or buildings, software architectures are not meant to be frozen in time. Software architecture should frequently be revisited for small or big improvements, as well as fundamental changes. Walter Vogel looks at this from his perspective in an enlightened [post](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html).<br/><br/>
* *"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.”* – Stephen Hawking

* Great [post](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/bet-on-growth) by Kent Beck to always bet on the growth rate, on the subject of ChatGPT right now still lagging behind in (some) coding skills. Beck reminds that in technology growth matters far more than absolute values and that limits to growth are valuable to overcome and so receive due attention and funding. 

## 2 May 2023
* Podcast tip of the week: [Engineering Enablement podcast](https://getdx.com/engineering-enablement-podcast). Plus a [throwback](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_developerproductivity-engineeringeffectiveness-activity-7059239786967932928-aR_Z) to a DevOps conference in 2017 with Nicole Forsgren and how much still remains valid today. 

## 30 April 2023
* Reflections on importance of traditions and how each tradition arises in a particular time and context. Still, the best traditions are those that remain relevant over time. Ergo, I spent the last of April once again introducing my kids and spouse to the traditions of my hometown on this particular day. More about it in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_valborgsm%C3%A4ssofirande-vid-gunillaklockan-i-activity-7058691518240296960-uXik)

## 27 April 2023
* Took part in a local event at the Google Stockholm office for financial services in Google Cloud. Really interesting to hear how Google sees the AI and ML space and what unique differentiators they are bringing to the table. [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_llms-googlecloud-financialservices-activity-7057393875702718464-Coz4)

## 24 April 2023
* Blunt copying from one company to another of best practices, insights and implementations is at it's best just blunt, but at it's worst "inviting disaster" as per Deming. A [short post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_people-copy-examples-and-wonder-why-they-activity-7056352166441009152-ROwH) on systems thinking and this topic. 

## 23 April 2023
* *"You can’t manage what you can’t measure. You can’t secure what you can’t see."*

## 22 April 2023
* Been a few days without content. Blame it on vacation and coming back to work after vacation. Anyways, here we go off again.  <br/><br/>
* It's been now 2 years at SEB, as I started in April of 2021 in the midst of the pandemic. Since day 1, it's been an eventful ride, with many highs and lows. Changing ways, practices and thinking in a nearly 170 years old institution requires patience, persistence, taking in different perspective and maintaining grit. Everyday has been a learning and growing opportunity and that's in essence what life is about, right?  <br/><br/>
* Summarised some of my initial experiments and experiences with FinOps in this LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_stockholm-finops-roadshow-activity-7054171153765990400--zJx) plus put an advertisement out for the FinOps Roadshow in Stockholm on 12th of May.  <br/><br/>
* Read the book Investments Unlimited from IT Revolution. Summary [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_investments-unlimited-it-revolution-activity-7052915404582625281-pVg7).<br/><br/>

* Deep fakes and online bank runs are a scary combo. In a digital first world, toppling banks in an online bank run, happens at amazing speeds. And as deep fakes, with the help of AI, are becoming all the more plausible and believable, the risk of a deep fake video causing a run has become all the greater. [Bloomberg Opinion article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/28/online-fakery-and-digital-bank-runs-are-a-scary-mix/1a63d426-cd57-11ed-8907-156f0390d081_story.html)<br/><br/>

* Recent years, months and weeks have seen a remarkable 
progress in the field of generative AI and large language models. This [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) made by OpenAI, Open Research and University of Pennsylvania investigates potential impact of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models on the US labour market. <br/><br/>
* The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/25/you-wait-ages-for-an-ai-chatbot-to-come-along-then-a-whole-bunch-turn-up-chatgpt) answers why the machine learning "breakthrough" moment happened to happen right now. A number of necessary but unconnected developments suddenly came together to create entirely new possibilities: 
"the availability of truly massive cloud-computing power; unimaginable quantities of data provided by the internet for training LLMs; significant improvements in algorithms boosted by neural networks; and oodles of money, provided by insanely profitable tech giants."<br/><br/>
* Reflecting on the US lawmakers grilling TikTok's CEO about it's ties to China. While I very well understand the US lawmakers's concerns about TikTok being (ab)used as a potential weapon against the free world, it's hard not to draw parallels between the Chinese National Security Law from 2017 and the American Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act or CLOUD Act from 2018.
