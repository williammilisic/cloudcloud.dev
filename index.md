* "*Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.*" - George Bernard Shaw<br/><br/>
* It’s interesting how sometimes certain technical topics and even single words or concepts, beget powerful gatekeepers who rather than invite a mutual exchange of perspectives, experiences and knowledge, seek to establish one single, one "officially" sanctioned, one sided, no-questions-asked point of view. <br/>Being a fan of Socratic thinking, I can find this one-sidedness surprising, as it hardly leads to overall progress or betterment.<br/><br/>

## 16 January 2024
* “*Aristotle described the formula. He did that two and a half thousand years ago. Not only did it work then, 
it still works today. So actually anyone who says there is no formula is wrong, there is. Aristotle did it in 
a way that makes it incredibly easy to remember. There’s three words – pity, fear and catharsis. He said you 
need to make the audience feel pity for a character. You do that usually by making the character go through
some undeserved misfortune. What that does – it enables the audience to emotionally connect with the character. 
And once the writer has got that emotional connection between the audience and the character, the writer begins 
to have some control over the audience. You then put the character into a worse and worse and worse situation. 
And because of the emotional connection, the identification, the audience feels fear. When you release the 
character from the jeopardy or whatever the situation they’re in, the audience experiences a catharsis. Pity, 
fear, catharsis.*” - Julian Friedmann, [TEDx Talk](https://youtu.be/al3-Kl4BDUQ?si=Yf6QuB-PlLFT6CnI)

It stands for co-operation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality, not because it wants people to be the same but because only through equality in our economic circumstances can our individuality develop properly.*" - Tony Blair, [1983 Maiden Speech](https://www.ukpol.co.uk/tony-blair-1983-maiden-speech-in-the-house-of-commons/) in the House of Commons<br/><br/>

* "*Tell me the facts and I’ll learn. Tell me the truth and I’ll believe. But tell me a story and it will live in my heart forever.*” - Native American proverb <br/><br/>
* Asyndeton (from the Greek: ἀσύνδετον, "unconnected") is a literary scheme in which one or several conjunctions are deliberately omitted from a series of related clauses. Its use can have the effect of speeding up the rhythm of a passage and making a single idea more memorable. <br/><br/>

One day in 1671, Christopher Wren observed three bricklayers on a scaffold, one crouched, one half-standing and one standing tall, working very hard and fast. To the first bricklayer, Christopher Wren asked the question, “What are you doing?” to which the bricklayer replied, “I’m a bricklayer. I’m working hard laying bricks to feed my family.” The second bricklayer, responded, “I’m a builder. I’m building a wall.” But the third brick layer, the most productive of the three and the future leader of the group, when asked the question, “What are you doing?” replied with a gleam in his eye, “I’m a cathedral builder. I’m building a great cathedral to The Almighty.”<br/><br/>

* Speaking of Netflix, I heard a great story today about how Reed Hastings intentionally removed members of his management team working with DVD rentals, from his weekly management team meeting. Although DVD rentals were what ultimately the company was making money on, these managers were not contributing to the long term goal of becoming a streaming company. How many leaders would take such a drastic decision of removing both loyal and business critical team members from a meeting in the light of them not being involved in company's longer term aspirations and strategy? The strategy worked. Netflix became THE streaming company and didn't go bust, like Blockbuster.  <br/><br/>

* Hoshin Kanri (Japanese: 方針管理, "policy management") is a 7-step process used in strategic planning in which strategic goals are communicated throughout the company and then put into action. The Hoshin Kanri strategic planning system originated from post-war Japan, but has since spread to the U.S. and around the world. Translated from Japanese, Hoshin Kanri aptly means "compass management". The individual words "hoshin" and "kanri" mean direction and administration, respectively. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshin_Kanri)<br/><br/>

* "*To deal with an uncertain future and still move forward, people should have strong opinions, which are weakly held.*” Coined at Palo Alto's Institute for the Future, by Paul Saffo. Weak opinions are problematic because people aren’t inspired to develop the best arguments possible for them, or to put forth the energy required to test them. It is just as important, however, to not be too attached to what you believe because, otherwise, it undermines your ability to “see” and “hear” evidence that clashes with your opinions. <br/><br/>

* "*If something external is causing you distress, it’s not the thing itself that’s troubling you but your judgment about it, and it’s within your power to erase that right now. And if it’s something internal to yourself, is anyone stopping you from looking at it in a more positive way? Likewise, if you’re distressed because you’re failing to do something that strikes you as sound, why not do it rather than indulge in distress?*" - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 8.47

## 17 August 2023
* "*The Law of Crappy People states: For any title level in a large organization, the talent on that level will eventually converge to the crappiest person with the title. 
The rationale behind the law is that the other employees in the company with lower titles will naturally benchmark themselves against the crappiest person at the next level. 
For example, if Jasper is the worst vice president in the company, then all of the directors will benchmark themselves against Jasper and demand promotions as soon as they reach his low level of competency.*"- Ben Horowitz<br/><br/>
* The Peter Principle, coined by Dr. Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull in their 1969 book **The Peter Principle**, contends that, in a hierarchy, people are sooner or later 
promoted to positions which they are no longer skilled to handle. This is their “level of incompetence.” This is where they stay.
In his book **High Output Management**, Andy Grove points out that this is largely unavoidable because there is no way to know a priori at what point the person will be incapable of handling further promotions.<br/><br/>
* "*MANAGING STRICTLY BY NUMBERS IS LIKE PAINTING BY NUMBERS Some things that you want to encourage will be quantifiable, and some will not. If you report on the quantitative goals and ignore the qualitative ones, you won’t get the qualitative goals, which may be the most important ones. Management purely by numbers is sort of like painting by numbers—it’s strictly for amateurs. At HP, the company wanted high earnings now and in the future. By focusing entirely on the numbers, HP got them now by sacrificing the future.*" - Ben Horowitz<br/><br/>
* "*We take care of the people, the products and the profits…in that order.*” - Jim Barksdale<br/><br/>

* "*Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.*" - Steve Jobs

* Explaining why "Lift and Shift Landing Zone" is a good and truthful concept for many cloud migrations, although only to be seen a first step, not the end goal. See [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_build-your-cloud-foundation-activity-7069027700174200833-VjDP).<br/><br/>

## 29 May 2023
* I was asked a while back to share the full list of my reads/listens. I found the request flattering but didn't think too much about it until I heard the same thing from another person, and then another. One is a dot, two is a line, three is a trend. Said and done, I've now extracted the list of books I've listened to from Audible since I started my monthly subscription in 2018. Think a few books from competing services are missing and I'll look to add those too shortly. As well of course hard copies of books, which I'll also add. To top it off, at some point, I will add more data about the books, including linking to my reviews on LinkedIn. Without any further ado, here is the [list](booklist.md).

* At the end of the day, company in any type of business is now, a software company. 
Even if previously your core product didn’t have a software component, now it’s unlikely that your core product doesn’t come with a software element attached. 
Failing to do your best with that software component, is equal to failing at your core product.

* An internal [document](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) from Google circulating reg Open Source and OpenAI. "*...in the end, OpenAI doesn’t matter. They are making the same mistakes we are in their posture relative to open source, and their ability to maintain an edge is necessarily in question. Open source alternatives can and will eventually eclipse them unless they change their stance. In this respect, at least, we can make the first move.*"

* Unlike bridges or buildings, software architectures are not meant to be frozen in time. Software architecture should frequently be revisited for small or big improvements, as well as fundamental changes. Walter Vogel looks at this from his perspective in an enlightened [post](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html).<br/><br/>

## 30 April 2023
* Reflections on importance of traditions and how each tradition arises in a particular time and context. Still, the best traditions are those that remain relevant over time. Ergo, I spent the last of April once again introducing my kids and spouse to the traditions of my hometown on this particular day.

* It's been now 2 years at SEB, as I started in April of 2021 in the midst of the pandemic. Since day 1, it's been an eventful ride, with many highs and lows. Changing ways, practices and thinking in a nearly 170 years old institution requires patience, persistence, taking in different perspective and maintaining grit. Everyday has been a learning and growing opportunity and that's in essence what life is about, right?  <br/><br/>

Really glad to contribute in any way I can getting the meet-up scene going after too many years of pandemic. <br/><br/>
* Deep fakes and online bank runs are a scary combo. In a digital first world, toppling banks in an online bank run, happens at amazing speeds. And as deep fakes, with the help of AI, are becoming all the more plausible and believable, the risk of a deep fake video causing a run has become all the greater. [Bloomberg Opinion article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/28/online-fakery-and-digital-bank-runs-are-a-scary-mix/1a63d426-cd57-11ed-8907-156f0390d081_story.html)<br/><br/>

* Recent years, months and weeks have seen a remarkable 
progress in the field of generative AI and large language models. This [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) made by OpenAI, Open Research and University of Pennsylvania investigates potential impact of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models on the US labour market. <br/><br/>
* The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/25/you-wait-ages-for-an-ai-chatbot-to-come-along-then-a-whole-bunch-turn-up-chatgpt) answers why the machine learning "breakthrough" moment happened to happen right now. A number of necessary but unconnected developments suddenly came together to create entirely new possibilities: 
"the availability of truly massive cloud-computing power; unimaginable quantities of data provided by the internet for training LLMs; significant improvements in algorithms boosted by neural networks; and oodles of money, provided by insanely profitable tech giants."<br/><br/>
* Reflecting on the US lawmakers grilling TikTok's CEO about it's ties to China. While I very well understand the US lawmakers's concerns about TikTok being (ab)used as a potential weapon against the free world, it's hard not to draw parallels between the Chinese National Security Law from 2017 and the American Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act or CLOUD Act from 2018.
