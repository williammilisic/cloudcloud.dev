> I have wanted to start with journaling for a really long time but have always come up with some reason or excuse not to. This time, I will try to make journaling to be about things, topics and aha-moments I encounter on a daily basis, that might also be interesting for others to learn about or discover. Sharing is caring, as the old saying goes, right!?

Weekend time with the family and we watched the movie **Lorax** from 2012, based upon a book by Dr. Seuss. A good movie for the whole family with an even great quote for future saving. <br/><br/>
*Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind, don't matter, and those who matter, don't mind.* - Dr. Seuss
