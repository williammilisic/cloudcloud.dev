> Cloud Cloud Dot Dev is about things, topics and aha-moments I encounter on a daily basis that I think may be interesting for saving and that also may be interesting for others to learn about or discover.
<br/>

## 6 June 2023
* Sweden's 500th birthday as free and independent nation is definitely cause for great celebration. To mark the occasion, here are five time tested Swedish [proverbs](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_sweden-500-swedense-activity-7071763188379246593-zmj1).

## 5 June 2023
* Apple's latest reveals can be somewhat stressful for some: [Everything Apple tried to kill at WWDC 2023](https://gizmodo.com/everything-apple-killed-wwdc-2023-sticker-journal-optic-1850508633/).

* Quote-for-saving: "*As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.*” - John McCarthy, who coined the term AI in 1956



## 30 May 2023
* Explaining why "Lift and Shift Landing Zone" is a good and truthful concept for many cloud migrations, although only to be seen a first step, not the end goal. See [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_build-your-cloud-foundation-activity-7069027700174200833-VjDP).<br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: "*The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.*" - Bertrand Russell

## 29 May 2023
* I was asked a while back to share the full list of my reads/listens. I found the request flattering but didn't think too much about it until I heard the same thing from another person, and then another. One is a dot, two is a line, three is a trend. Said and done, I've now extracted the list of books I've listened to from Audible since I started my monthly subscription in 2018. Think a few books from competing services are missing and I'll look to add those too shortly. As well of course hard copies of books, which I'll also add. To top it off, at some point, I will add more data about the books, including linking to my reviews on LinkedIn. Without any further ado, here is the [list](booklist.md).


## 27 May 2023
* At the end of the day, company in any type of business is now, a software company. 
Even if previously your core product didn’t have a software component, now it’s unlikely that your core product doesn’t come with a software element attached. 
Failing to do your best with that software component, is equal to failing at your core product.

## 26 May 2023
* A quick book [review](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_agile-lean-cloudcomputing-activity-7067741149242830848-udAi) on "The Journey to Enterprise Agility" by Daryl Kulak and Hong Li. The book is a good starting point, in case you're wondering how to develop effective interfaces between enterprise methodology and Agile practices. 

## 24 May 2023
* Tina Turner, the Queen of Rock'n'Roll, has died at 83. <br/>Quote-for-saving: *"People think my life has been tough, but I think it's been a wonderful journey. The older you get, the more you realise it's not what happened, it's how you deal with it."*

## 19 May 2023
* An internal [document](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) from Google circulating reg Open Source and OpenAI. "*...in the end, OpenAI doesn’t matter. They are making the same mistakes we are in their posture relative to open source, and their ability to maintain an edge is necessarily in question. Open source alternatives can and will eventually eclipse them unless they change their stance. In this respect, at least, we can make the first move.*" 


## 15 May 2023
* [Short post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_commute-worklife-balance-activity-7063948475914231808-vTlj) on my commute to work, running through the forest in the Haga park.

## 13 May 2023
* [Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_goals-targets-achievements-activity-7063413821557604353-MKN) on how to be true with one's current standings and set achievable stretch goals, when applied to running, but also applicable to life as a whole. 

## 11 May 2023
* Some interesting readings (so far) this week:
* [The new era of resiliency in the cloud](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-new-era-of-resiliency-in-the-cloud) - a good McKinsey post on resiliency.

## 10 May 2023
* A [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_work-life-health-activity-7061939159145349120-wyaR) on Via Negativa and how by doing less and removing things we can do more and better. <br/><br/>
* [Google I/O](https://io.google/2023/) with a number of AI [announcements](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/10/google-launches-palm-2-its-next-gen-large-language-model/) and inclusions to Google services.

## 5 May 2023
* Unlike bridges or buildings, software architectures are not meant to be frozen in time. Software architecture should frequently be revisited for small or big improvements, as well as fundamental changes. Walter Vogel looks at this from his perspective in an enlightened [post](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html).<br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.”* – Stephen Hawking

## 4 May 2023
* Some reflections on benefits of micro segmentation in Cloud environments and how difficult it can be in case you don't do it right off the bat. [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_security-reliability-devops-activity-7059758409125904384-H6Q8)<br/><br/>
* Great [post](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/bet-on-growth) by Kent Beck to always bet on the growth rate, on the subject of ChatGPT right now still lagging behind in (some) coding skills. Beck reminds that in technology growth matters far more than absolute values and that limits to growth are valuable to overcome and so receive due attention and funding. 

## 2 May 2023
* Podcast tip of the week: [Engineering Enablement podcast](https://getdx.com/engineering-enablement-podcast). Plus a [throwback](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_developerproductivity-engineeringeffectiveness-activity-7059239786967932928-aR_Z) to a DevOps conference in 2017 with Nicole Forsgren and how much still remains valid today. 

## 30 April 2023
* Reflections on importance of traditions and how each tradition arises in a particular time and context. Still, the best traditions are those that remain relevant over time. Ergo, I spent the last of April once again introducing my kids and spouse to the traditions of my hometown on this particular day. More about it in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_valborgsm%C3%A4ssofirande-vid-gunillaklockan-i-activity-7058691518240296960-uXik)

## 27 April 2023
* Took part in a local event at the Google Stockholm office for financial services in Google Cloud. Really interesting to hear how Google sees the AI and ML space and what unique differentiators they are bringing to the table. [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_llms-googlecloud-financialservices-activity-7057393875702718464-Coz4)

## 24 April 2023
* Blunt copying from one company to another of best practices, insights and implementations is at it's best just blunt, but at it's worst "inviting disaster" as per Deming. A [short post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_people-copy-examples-and-wonder-why-they-activity-7056352166441009152-ROwH) on systems thinking and this topic. 

## 23 April 2023
* Quote-for-saving: *"You can’t manage what you can’t measure. You can’t secure what you can’t see."*

## 22 April 2023
* Been a few days without content. Blame it on vacation and coming back to work after vacation. Anyways, here we go off again.  <br/><br/>
* It's been now 2 years at SEB, as I started in April of 2021 in the midst of the pandemic. Since day 1, it's been an eventful ride, with many highs and lows. Changing ways, practices and thinking in a nearly 170 years old institution requires patience, persistence, taking in different perspective and maintaining grit. Everyday has been a learning and growing opportunity and that's in essence what life is about, right?  <br/><br/>
* Summarised some of my initial experiments and experiences with FinOps in this LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_stockholm-finops-roadshow-activity-7054171153765990400--zJx) plus put an advertisement out for the FinOps Roadshow in Stockholm on 12th of May.  <br/><br/>
* Read the book Investments Unlimited from IT Revolution. Summary [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_investments-unlimited-it-revolution-activity-7052915404582625281-pVg7).<br/><br/>

## 13 April 2023
* Itamar Gilad has an insightful [article](https://itamargilad.com/net-promoter-score-part2/) why NPS (Net Promoter Score) (like any framework or methodology really) is not to be followed blindly. <br/><br/>
* Sterling Bank's Engine SaaS branch on why Cloud is an innovation enabler as well as a compliance must for them. Article [here](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/41919/starling-on-scalability-and-being-cut-from-the-cloud/cloud).

## 7 April 2023
* Techcrunch has an interesting [piece](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/a-knife-so-sharp-you-dont-feel-it-cut/) on how generative AI is near perfect at inoffensive, blend CorpSpeak and marketing copy, in turn disrupting and replacing millions of jobs engaged in just this endeavour. <br/><br/>

## 6 April 2023
* Quote-for-saving: *""The world has enough for everyone's needs, but not everyone's greed."* - Mahatma Gandhi <br/><br/>
* Jennifer Brady tells the story how to introduce financial services governance to DevOps. [Article on Medium](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/devops-and-governance-56f6ecae1181).<br/><br/>

## 5 April 2023
* Ofcom (Office of Communications - UK regulatory body for broadcasting, telecommunications and post) is highlightning anticompetitive practices by major Cloud providers: data egress costs, technical restrictions on interoperability, committed usage discounts. Article [here](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2023/ofcom-proposes-to-refer-uk-cloud-market-for-investigation). <br/><br/>

## 4 April 2023
* New Google Flights [feature](https://mashable.com/article/google-flights-price-guarantee) guarantees the lowest price, pays you back if it’s wrong. Caveat: it only works in the US right now and with airlines using "Book on Google" feature. Still interesting move. <br/><br/>

## 3 April 2023
* On the 30th March, Bloomberg announced [BloombergGPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/). This LLM has been trained on a wide range of financial data to support a diverse set of NLP tasks within the financial industry. It has been trained using both public and private data sets, to produce an LLM with a competitive edge in the financial services on ChatGPT and other "generic" GPTs. <br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"Leaders are not the problem. Bad leaders are the problem. Challenge is to create a culture where good leadership is the norm.”*

* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/04/01/april-fools-pranks-hoaxes-2023/) has a honourable? tradition of debunking April Fools' pranks. <br/><br/>
* A little [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_april1st-activity-7047821122788110336-i8hq) in the spirit of Aprils Fools as to why I think onprem is better than Cloud.

## 31 March 2023
* Ars Technica is writing a [piece](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-assistant-might-be-doomed-division-reorganizes-to-focus-on-bard/) on Google refocusing efforts from Google Assistant to Bard. Just like [Alexa](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/) it seems Google Assistant, isn't making any money for the parent company. <br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"Change is inevitable. Growth is optional."* - John C. Maxwell

## 30 March 2023
* An interesting ROI measurement on [Backstage](https://backstage.io) was released today by Spotify. The developers that use Backstage are both more productive, content and retained longer at the company than non-users of Backstage. Check out the analysis right [here](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/how-spotify-measures-backstage-roi/?utm_campaign=FY23%20-%20Blog%3A%20Backstage%20by%20the%20Numbers&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Xr0BcvVUXCm3gpI6IcWUIEqZqf1Ipoh6e7k94ex9oDnKWezlF0ar3heqk-gCosVcpnn85UJ0hB04QsUohmkitcVqHMw&_hsmi=252403474&utm_content=252403474&utm_source=hs_email&hsCtaTracking=08661d3f-d640-454b-bf55-ac04726b1ad3%7Cd00f0188-d378-4e37-9530-ded38d534323). <br/><br/>
<!-- ![](../images/backstage-2023-03-30.png)<br/>-->
* The leaps in AI are just massive. Here's a driverless [Cruise](https://getcruise.com) vehicle making its way through North Beach on St. Patrick's day. Seems AVs will be able to take on pretty hairy situations quite soon. Link to the [video](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046893618195795968/).<br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"I can make the trains run on time. But that trait is not conducive to being a leader. That’s a great trait for being a manager. Leadership is a vision. It’s inspiration, it's execution, it’s instincts. It is not just letting the trains run on time."* From [20VC podcast episode with Sequoia'a Doug Leone](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1WuBfXCeERhgiXloheaaoo?si=QZlnTjvHStGEknTcPzFIPA&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A3j2KMcZTtgTNBKwtZBMHvl).<br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."* - Confucius

## 29 March 2023
* Had great fun at a meet-up co-arranged with [Continuous Delivery Stockholm](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williammilisic_cloud-cicd-continuousdelivery-activity-7046954939008303104-2XUk). Really glad to contribute in any way I can getting the meet-up scene going after too many years of pandemic. <br/><br/>
* Deep fakes and online bank runs are a scary combo. In a digital first world, toppling banks in an online bank run, happens at amazing speeds. And as deep fakes, with the help of AI, are becoming all the more plausible and believable, the risk of a deep fake video causing a run has become all the greater. [Bloomberg Opinion article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/28/online-fakery-and-digital-bank-runs-are-a-scary-mix/1a63d426-cd57-11ed-8907-156f0390d081_story.html)<br/><br/>
* Stumbled upon [Minimum Viable Secure Product Controls checklist](https://mvsp.dev/mvsp.en/) while listening to episode 114 of [Cloud Security podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/515p7nUYU8MUdzyGfMuB9H). It's a quite usable minimalistic security checklist for B2B software and business process outsourcing suppliers.

## 28 March 2023
* Trying out [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai) iPhone app. It's like ChatGPT but with cited sources and voice searches. Perplexity is backed by some of the key people and pioneers in search, consumer products, and artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>
* [Cloud Security Podcast](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/cloudsecurity/podcast/ep96-cloud-security-observability-for-detection-and-response/) Episode 96 has some interesting insights and take-aways from Jeff Bollinger, Director of Incident Response and Detection Engineering at LinkedIn. The episode focuses on how to best approach observability in Cloud. One of many good take-aways is on using defined but not used subnets as honeypots. <br/><br/>
* Goldman Sachs estimates that two-thirds of current jobs in the US and the European Union are exposed to some degree of AI automation. Administrative and legal sectors are expected to be the most impacted, with 46% of administrative jobs and 44% of legal jobs being substitutable by AI. 
The research shows that AI will impact roughly half of the activities people do across all sectors, and nearly all occupations will be affected by automation. [Financial Times article](https://www.ft.com/content/50b15701-855a-4788-9a4b-5a0a9ee10561)


## 27 March 2023
* Sequoia Capital's [newest market map](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFYS4hT4yMi3g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1679679479724?e=1682553600&v=beta&t=t-B1CLx2ddYGvLA55ipMj1AwrMfqGHJsGR4R9kxZ6sk). It showcases Sequoia's belief that that the AI revolution is the most consequential computational trend in decades. AI is rewriting what software can do and expanding the pool of who can write software. Full article [here](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/). <br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"Skipping software tests to save time is like getting a head start in a race by not tying your shoes. You're not getting ahead, you're going to stumble."* <br/><br/>
* Sequoia [article](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/) on Generative AI predicts rise of "killer" apps just like smartphones 15 years ago unleashed new types of applications through new capabilities like GPS, cameras and on-the-go connectivity. The article speculates how different fundamental models will evolve over the coming years and what sort of associated applications will become possible. <br/>

## 26 March 2023
* Weekend time with the family and we watched the movie **Lorax** from 2012, based upon a book by Dr. Seuss. A good movie for the whole family with a great quote for future saving. <br/><br/>
* Quote-for-saving: *"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind, don't matter, and those who matter, don't mind."* - Dr. Seuss<br/><br/>
* Recent years, months and weeks have seen a remarkable 
progress in the field of generative AI and large language models. This [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) made by OpenAI, Open Research and University of Pennsylvania investigates potential impact of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models on the US labour market. <br/><br/>
* The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/25/you-wait-ages-for-an-ai-chatbot-to-come-along-then-a-whole-bunch-turn-up-chatgpt) answers why the machine learning "breakthrough" moment happened to happen right now. A number of necessary but unconnected developments suddenly came together to create entirely new possibilities: 
"the availability of truly massive cloud-computing power; unimaginable quantities of data provided by the internet for training LLMs; significant improvements in algorithms boosted by neural networks; and oodles of money, provided by insanely profitable tech giants."<br/><br/>
* Reflecting on the US lawmakers grilling TikTok's CEO about it's ties to China. While I very well understand the US lawmakers's concerns about TikTok being (ab)used as a potential weapon against the free world, it's hard not to draw parallels between the Chinese National Security Law from 2017 and the American Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act or CLOUD Act from 2018.
